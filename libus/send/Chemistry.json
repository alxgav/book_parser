The topics covered range from a basic treatment of crystalline electric-field effects and chemical interactions in organic solvents, to separation processes, electrochemical beaviors which impact corrosion, oxidation resistance, chemical energy storage and sensor technology, and to analytical procedures.Underlying the most subtle chemical and optical properties of these elements and their compounds in the condensed state are the crystal field effects. This phenomenon in non-metallic compounds is discussed in chapter six. The volume opens with a review of important new solvent extraction procedures as well as emerging alternative separation processes such as photochemical separation, precipitation stripping and supercritical extraction. Scientific and industrial procedures are illustrated. In a further chapter eight major analytical techniques of obtaining accurate trace analysis are examined, tabulated and assessed. The most effective procedures of each are also reviewed. Chapter two considers a wide variety of methods using rare-earth solutions and slats to modify advantageously the costly deterioration of metals and alloys. This topic is expanded in the following chapter, paying particular attention to protection against high-temperature oxidation, sulfidization and hot-salt corrosion. The following two chapters are concerned with the versatility of the rare earths in addressing current technical problems such the use of rare-earth intermetallics, principally LaNi3-based materials, to provide the skyrocketing need for environmetally friendly, usually portable, battery power. The final chapter is a review of the solvation, interaction and coordination of rare-earth salts in a variety of organic solvents including dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, various alcohols, acetonitrile and propylenecarbonate under strict anhydrous conditions. A contrast of these interactions with those in which water is present with organic solvents is also made.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "1995", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "427", "ISBN10": "0444821783", "ISBN13": "9780444821782", "file": "DJVU, 4.13 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550127/e96047"},

The authors bring us up to date on the status of our knowledge of valence fluctuation and heavy fermion 4f systems as gleaned from neutron scattering experiments. The major topics include cerium-based valence fluctuation systems, cerium-based heavy fermion materials and ytterbium-based materials. The remaining quarter of the chapter deals with samarium-, europium- and thulium-based systems.  The next chapter deals with the thermal conductivity of rare earth containing materials and is the first major review on this topic. A great deal of information can be obtained on the electrical and magnetic nature of these solids, because of the varied response of the thermal conductivity to long range magnetic order, spin glass behavior, heavy fermions and Kondo lattices, crystalline electric fields, and superconductivity in metallic systems. The thermal conductivity of insulators and semiconductors is also reviewed.  The third and fourth chapters deal with special classes of materials rather than measuring techniques as found in the first two chapters and the last one of this volume.  The authors discuss the chemistry, structure, electrical, magnetic and thermal behaviors, spectroscopic (vibrational, ultraviolet-visible and M\u00f6ssbauer) properties, and luminescence of pyrochlores.  The longest chapter in this book deals with the crystal structures of approximately 100 of the \u02dc225 known minerals. These minerals were grouped into five classes based on the types of anionic groups found in the various structures. Within each class the minerals are arranged by the sizes of the anionic groups (isolated groups, chains, sheets or plates, and three-dimensional frameworks). The chapter is well illustrated with drawings of the structures and anion coordination polyhedra around the rare earth ion.  The last chapter is concerned with appearance potential spectroscopy (APS), which measures the probability for electronic excitation of a core level as a function of the incident electron energy.

Unfortunately, it was largely overlooked until about 1940. Since then, numerous papers have been published supporting and developing the theory, which is becoming known as the electronic theory of acids and bases.According to the Lewis theory, acidity and basicity have nothing to do with the presence of any one element or specific group of elements. Nor is any particular substance to be considered an acid or a base in an absolute sense. Acidity and basicity are relative terms indicating certain types of experimental behavior which may be exhibited by the vast majority of chemical compounds.

Lemm"], "rating": "0", "description": "Among the numerous applications of the rare-earth elements, the field of catalysis accounts for a large number. Catalysis represents approximately 20% of the total market sales of rare earths worldwide. As a matter of fact two main applications have been prominent in the last decades: zeolite stabilization for fluid cracking catalysts, and automotive post-combustion catalytic treatment.  The oldest use of rare earths in catalysis deals with the structural and chemical stabilization of the zeolites for petroleum cracking applications. For a long time this has been an area of application for non-separated rare earths. The addition of several percent of rare earths in the pores of the zeolite results in a strong surface acidity, which is essential for an efficient conversion of high-weight molecules into lighter species, like low-octane fuel, even in the very aggressive conditions of the petroleum industry.  The popular demand for high-quality air in spite of the traffic congestion in large cities resulted in larger and larger constraints in the emission exhaust from cars. Thus highly efficient catalysts have had to be designed, and due to the combination of its redox properties and very good thermal stability, cerium oxide has been since the beginning, early in the 1980s, a major component of the three-way catalysts (TWC) now used in all modern gasoline cars.  The future of rare earths in catalysis is probably bright. The fact  that approximately 400 patents are applied for yearly in the area since 1992 is an illustration of a very active area. Usage of rare earths in catalysis is expected to grow due to their highly specific properties. Instead of the physical properties used in electronic applications, one deals now with redox properties, water and thermal stability, coordination numbers and so forth. The rare earths are so specific in these properties that their use can hardly be avoided, not only for the beauty of academic studies but also for the development of industrial applications with immediate influence on everyday life.   Careful control of the synthesis conditions and the definition of optimum composition in each case are the keys to the preparation of highly performing compounds for catalytic applications. They must actually be considered as high performance products with functional properties, and not just chemical species.  Chapters devoted primarily to catalysis have been published in earlier volumes of the Handbook. In this volume several more are added. The first is an extension of the earlier chapter 43, on interactions at surfaces of metals and alloys, to reactions such as hydrogenation, methanation, ammonia synthesis, saturated hydrocarbon reactions, dehydrogenation of hydrogenated materials, hydrodesulfurization, and carbon monoxide oxidation. The second chapter reports on the wide variety of catalyzed reactions involving metals and alloys in the innovated form of metal overlayers or bimetallic compounds with some transition metals produced from ammonia solutions. This is followed by  a chapter on catalysis with mixed oxides usually having perovskite or perovskite-related structures.   Then follows a comprehensive discussion on the background and current role of cerium oxide and associated materials for post-treatment of exhaust gases for pollution control. These three-way catalysts (TWC) are designed to render harmless the CO, NOx, and unburned hydrocarbons from internal combustion engines. The next chapter considers the wide field of zeolite catalysts containing rare earths from their historic use in petroleum refining in the 1960s to other petrochemical and fine chemical applications today. The final chapter documents the use of the triflates (the trifluoro-methane-sulfonyl group which is a hard Lewis acid in both aqueous and organic solutions) as versatile catalysts in carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. Their stability in the presence of water, in spite of their being hard Lewis acids, enhances their growing usefulness.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2000", "edition": "1", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "423", "ISBN10": "0444504729", "ISBN13": "9780444504722", "file": "DJVU, 3.84 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550135/8d271a"},

Understanding the action of biological macromolecules (giant molecules) requires detailed knowledge of their structures. Most of the more than ten thousand known structures of protein and nucleic acids were obtained by x-ray crystallography, the standard mechanism for determining protein structure. Essentially, proteins are frozen into rigid crystals, which can be stacked up in a repeating pattern--like supermarket displays. The structure of each individual crystal can be determined by the way x-rays are bent when they pass through the composite crystal. Protein structure is essential when investigating protein interactions and planning drug development.\nCrystallography Made Crystal Clear, Second Edition explains how scientists discover the structures of the macromolecules. Scientists do not see these molecules directly. Instead, they build models as a means of interpreting data from x-ray diffraction by crystals, or by irradiation by other forms of energy. Users of these models need to know how they are obtained in order to know what they are seeing when they study a model of a macromolecule. They also need to know how to judge whether conclusions they draw from the molecular models are really supported by the models. This book uses visual and geometric models to help readers understand the mathematics that forms the basis of x-ray crystallography.\nThe field of protein crystallography is growing every day and has been instrumental in discovering the molecular principles of biology and in discovering new drugs, such as the recent protease inhibitors for AIDS. The field includes the largest percentage of Nobel prizes than any other scientific discipline. Every major university and drug company has a protein crystallography laboratory and this book is an invaluable aid to those wishing to practice protein crystallography\nor just learn more about how it is actually done.\nKey Features\n* Provides clear, understandable descriptions of principles of X-ray crystallography\n* Leads reader through unintimidating and thorough explanations of the underlying mathematics\n* Provides abundant illustrations, including diagrams, charts, photographs, and color stereo\n* images\n* Explains how to read crystallography papers in research journals\n* Includes brief descriptions of other diffraction methods (neutron, electron, Laue) and the kinds\n* of structural information they can provide\n* Introduces other methods of macromolecular structure determination (NMR spectroscopy and\n* homology modeling), and provides guidance in judging the quality of these models", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "year": "1999", "edition": "2", "publisher": "Academic Press", "language": "english", "pages": "305", "ISBN10": "0125870728", "ISBN13": "9780125870726", "file": "PDF, 5.87 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/510046", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/510046/16d3da"},

The mass spectrum produced by electron impact ionization presents a pattern of peaks that can often give definitive structural information about an unknown compound. Introductory Mass Spectrometry, Second Edition guides readers in the understanding and recognition of those patterns, discussing mass spectra in terms that are familiar to chemists. It provides a basis for chemists to interpret mass spectra to solve particular structural problems.The Second Edition has been updated with modern techniques and data handling. Beginning with an introduction to the principles and instrumentation, it then sequentially explains the processes that occur in the mass spectrometer following ionization. The book is unique in the large number of mass spectra presented and provides examples of mass spectra from a wide variety of organic chemicals, concentrating on the relationships between fragmentation patterns, common chemical reactions, and chemical structures. The book also discusses mass spectra obtained with softer ionization techniques, which provide definitive information regarding molecular weights.The text describes mass spectra produced by electron ionization, discussing how the spectral peak pattern relates to molecular structure. It details the use of high-resolution and accurate mass measurement to determine elemental composition of ions in order to identify unknown substances. The book also introduces some of the recent techniques that can be employed to extend the usefulness of mass spectrometry to high molecular weight substances and more polar substances.

Offering a comprehensive review, this book enables readers to develop a fundamental understanding of how HILIC works and then apply that knowledge to develop and implement a variety of practical applications. Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography begins with discussions of HILIC retention mechanisms, stationary phases, and general method development. This sets the foundation for the book's extensive coverage of applications. The authors address unique separation challenges for bioanalytical, environmental, pharmaceutical, and biochemical applications. Moreover, there is a thorough discussion of HILIC in two-dimensional chromatography. With contributions from leading analytical scientists who have extensive experience in HILIC as well as HPLC, Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography serves as a practical guide for researchers, featuring: Detailed examples of HILIC methods and development approaches Thorough explanations of retention mechanisms and the impact of stationary phase and mobile phase properties on separations Step-by-step guidance for developing efficient, sensitive, and robust HILIC methods References to the primary literature at the end of each chapter Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography is written for scientists who use or develop analytical methods for the separation of polar compounds. In particular, these researchers will discover how HILIC can be used to analyze and better understand the composition of pharmaceutical, bioanalytical, biochemical, chemical, food, and environmental samples.

In this context, flow analysis is very attractive, as they the flow-based procedures are characterized by enhanced analytical figures of merit. Moreover, the flow analysers do not usually require sophisticated and expensive instrumentation, are amenable to full automation and to miniaturization, and are well suited for in situ analyses.  The tendency to carry out traditional methods of analysis in the flow analyser has becoming more pronounced, especially in relation to large-scale routine analyses. The technology of solution handling has become more and more improved, leading to enhanced strategies for chemical assays. Consequently, different modalities of flow analysis (e.g. SFA, FIA, SIA) have been conceived, developed and applied to solve real problems. Most of the flow-based analytical procedures presently in use, however, do not exploit the full potential of flow analysis.  The main object of the book is then to provide a scientific basis and to familiarise a wide community of researchers, students, technicians, etc with the uses of flow analysis. Emphasis is given to spectrophotometric and luminometric detection, in relation to agronomical, geological, industrial, pharmaceutical and environmental applications.  The book includes historical and theoretical aspects, recent achievements in instrumentation, guidelines for methodology implementation, and applications.

They include the laser selection of atomic and molecular velocities for the purpose of Doppler-free spectroscopy, laser control of the position and velocity of atoms (i.e. laser trapping and cooling of atoms), and laser control of atomic and molecular processes (ionization, dissociation) with a view of detecting single atoms and molecules and particularly separating isotopes and nuclear isomers. Over the last decades the principal problems posed have been successfully solved, and many of them have evolved remarkably in the subsequent investigations of the international research community. For example, the solution of the problem of laser cooling and trapping of atoms has given birth to the new field of physics of ultracold mater, i.e. quantum atomic and molecular gases. The laser non-coherent control of uni-molecular processes have found an interesting extension in the field of laser coherent control of molecules. The concept of laser control of positions has been successfully demonstrated with microparticles (optical tweezers), concurrently with investigations into atomic control. The laser photo-ionization of molecules on surfaces has led to the development of novel techniques of laser assisted mass spectrometry of macromolecules, and so on. The aim of this book is to review these topics from a unified or 'coherent' point of view.

Yet these same chemical processes that provide products and materials essential to modern economies, also generate substantial quantities of wastes and emissions. Green Chemistry is the utilization of a set of principles that reduces or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances in design. Due to extravagant costs needed to managing these wastes, tens of billions of dollars a year, there is a need to propose a way to create less waste. Emission and treatment standards continue to become more stringent, which causes these costs to continue to escalate.  This book describes both the science (theory) and engineering (application) principles of Green Chemistry that lead to the generation of less waste. It explores the use of milder manufacturing conditions resulting from the use of smarter organic synthetic techniques and the maintenance of atom efficiency that can temper the effects of chemical processes. By implementing these techniques means less waste, which will save industry millions of dollars over time.                                         \u00c2\u00b7 Chemical processes that provide products and materials essential to modern economies generate substantial quantities of wastes and emissions, this new book describes both the science (theory) and engineering (application) principles of Green Chemistry that lead to the generation of less waste \u00c2\u00b7 This book contains expert advise from scientists around the world, encompassing developments in the field since 2000 \u00c2\u00b7 Aids manufacturers, scientists, managers, and engineers on how to implement ongoing changes in a vast developing field that is important to the environment and our lives", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Elsevier; Academic Press", "language": "english", "pages": "343", "ISBN10": "1865843830", "ISBN13": "9780123725325", "file": "PDF, 1.69 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/665129", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/665129/57b4a2"},

Not only the chemical composition of a particular material plays a crucial role for many applications but also its structure. The proper choice of the chemical precursors and the preparation technique to obtain a material with the desired chemical and physical properties is a challenge for both material scientists and inorganic chemists.          This is the first book to give a comprehensive overview of the current methods for chemical synthesis of inorganic materials. The spectrum ranges from solid state reactions, CVD, reactions of aqueous systems, preparation and modification of inorganic polymers to the synthesis of tailored porous materials. With examples of selected technically applied materials for each method the general principles and requirements as well as the material properties and application of the resulting products are discussed. Numerous tables with further examples help to assess the scope and limitation of the various methods and to choose a suitable synthesis for a given problem.

Process analytical chemistry (PAC), or process analytical technology (PAT) as it has recently been called, is now being deployed in the pharmaceutical industry, where it is seen as a technology that can help companies to improve their conformity with manufacturing compliance regulations.The objective of this book is to provide a starting point for implementing process analytical chemistry tools in process monitoring applications or as part of a total quality management system. Written from the perspective of the spectroscopist required to implant PAT tools in a process environment, attention is focussed on measurements that are made \"in process\" at-line or off-line, providing data on product during manufacture.

The science of liquid chromatography, however, was revolutionized a few years ago with the advent of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC), which made it possible for researchers to analyze sample compounds with greater speed, resolution, and sensitivity.Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Its Applications enables readers to maximize the performance of UHPLC as well as develop UHPLC methods tailored to their particular research needs. Readers familiar with HPLC methods will learn how to transfer these methods to a UHPLC platform and vice versa. In addition, the book explores a variety of UHPLC applications designed to support research in such fields as pharmaceuticals, food safety, clinical medicine, and environmental science.The book begins with discussions of UHPLC method development and method transfer between HPLC and UHPLC platforms. It then examines practical aspects of UHPLC. Next, the book covers:Coupling UHPLC with mass spectrometryPotential of shell particles in fast liquid chromatographyDetermination of abused drugs in human biological matricesAnalyses of isoflavones and flavonoidsTherapeutic protein characterizationAnalysis of illicit drugsThe final chapter of the book explores the use of UHPLC in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics studies for traditional Chinese medicine.With its frank discussions of UHPLC's benefits and limitations, Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Its Applications equips analytical scientists with the skills and knowledge needed to take full advantage of this new separation technology", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2013", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Wiley", "language": "english", "pages": "304 / 299", "ISBN10": "0470938420", "ISBN13": "9780470938423", "file": "PDF, 4.13 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2323330", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2323330/362109"},

These methods are important primarily in polymer science, but also in advanced materials science and emerging technologies. Readers will learn how light scattering measurements can easily provide absolute molar mass and size without any calibration or using reference standards and how its potential can be multiplied by the combination with a separation technique. Current users of conventional SEC will learn that a light scattering detector effectively solves the crucial problem of SEC, i.e. the column calibration, significantly improves reproducibility of SEC measurements and provides much additional information. In addition, they will see that A4F can overcome many traditional SEC problems, such as interactions of polymers with column packing, shearing degradation and limited separation of ultra-high molar mass polymers.The book also\u00a0 provides understanding the basic theory and principles of light scattering, SEC and A4F. The theoretical part is accomplished by numerous examples of the real applications of particular methods and their combinations for various synthetic and natural polymers, proteins and nanoparticles. Special attention is paid to the characterization of branched polymers.The book targets beginners as well as the experienced users who need to confirm their own understanding or help interpret their results.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2011", "edition": "1", "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons", "language": "english", "pages": "372", "ISBN10": "0470386177", "ISBN13": "9780470386170", "file": "PDF, 2.40 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1168567", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1168567/c42705"},

In an effort to reverse this trend, Handbook of Sample Preparation shows why sample preparation deserves closer scientific scrutiny, and makes a compelling case for colleges and professional laboratories to devote more resources to promote the benefits of its correct application. Handbook of Sample Preparation includes:A solid overview of standard sampling methodologies and their analytical capabilities An introduction of non-traditional sampling technologies, which address the need for solvent-free alternatives, automation, and miniaturization A discussion of the analytical shift toward performing sampling on-site, rather than in the laboratory An examination of various extraction technologies and their applications for different types of matrices A look at how to take advantage of new sampling strategies to streamline laboratory procedures, reduce research costs, and increase overall productivity  An excellent primer on the fundamentals of extraction as well as a sound guide on the latest technological upgrades influencing current sampling techniques, this versatile text serves as an important and accessible tool for both students and seasoned practitioners as they seek new avenues for improving the accuracy of their analyses.Content: Chapter 1 Theory of Extraction (pages 1\u201324): Janusz PawliszynChapter 2 Headspace Gas Chromatography (pages 25\u201337): Zelda E.

Accordingly, some significant experiments are, perhaps wisely, never attempted, while the literature is sadly replete with flawed attempts at rigorous voltammetry. This book presents problems and worked solutions for a wide range of theoretical and experimental subjects in the field of voltammetry. The reader is assumed to have knowledge up to a Master's level of physical chemistry, but no exposure to electrochemistry in general, or voltammetry in particular, is required. The problems included range in difficulty from senior undergraduate to research level, and develop important practical approaches in voltammetry. The problems presented in the earlier chapters focus on the fundamental theories of thermodynamics, electron transfer and diffusion. Voltammetric experiments and their analysis are then considered, including extensive problems on both macroelectrode and microelectrode voltammetry. Convection, hydrodynamic electrodes, homogeneous kinetics, adsorption and electroanalytical applications are discussed in the later chapters, as well as problems on two rapidly developing fields of voltammetry: weakly supported media and nanoscale electrodes. There is huge interest in the experimental procedure of voltammetry at present, and yet no dedicated question and answer book with exclusive voltammetric focus exists, in spite of the inherent challenges of the subject.

The increased importance of these techniques can be seen as the result of three more or less parallel developments:\u2022 a tempestuous development of TA measuring techniques in combination with a high degree of automation,\u2022 the strongly increased understanding of the underlaying theory and,\u2022 the increasing knowledge of the relation between the polymers' chemical structure and their physical properties.These areas are still in their developmental stages, especially the third area. The increasing knowledge of the dependence of physical properties on chemical structure just accentuated more and more the need for accurate thermoanalytical measurements, and this knowledge is very important for the first stages of the development of new polymeric systems. Besides, the contribution of TA remains necessary for the technical and commercial development of such a new polymer system. The use of the various TA techniques in these processes is described in this book in nine chapters, while chapter ten illustrates the information obtained about different polymers during special case studies.This book illustrates in this way, applications of a wide variety of TA techniques whilst it is written from a materials characterisation rather than from a TA point of view with attention being paid to the chemical structure/physical properties correlations.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2001", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Elsevier Science", "language": "english", "pages": "407", "ISBN10": "0444506047", "file": "PDF, 12.72 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/562332", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/562332/0ad6bd"},

Now in its second edition, this revised and updated version of the Handbook of HPLC examines the new advances made in this field since the publication of the benchmark first edition twelve years ago. It reports detailed information on fundamental and practical aspects of HPLC related to conventional format and sophisticated novel approaches which have been developed to address a variety of separation problems in different fields. The latest concepts  New concepts presented in this edition include monolithic columns, bonded stationary phases, micro-HPLC, two-dimensional comprehensive liquid chromatography, gradient elution mode, and capillary electromigration techniques. The book also discusses LC-MS interfaces, nonlinear chromatography, displacement chromatography of peptides and proteins, field-flow fractionation, retention models for ions, and polymer HPLC. Fundamentals and applications  The first section of the book explores emerging novel aspects of HPLC and related separation methods based on the differential velocity of analytes in a liquid medium under the action of either an electric field (capillary electromigration techniques) or a gravitational field (field-flow fractionation). The section focusing on applications highlights four significant areas in which HPLC is successfully employed: chiral pharmaceutical, environmental analysis, food analysis, and forensic science.  Ideal for a widespread audience  Explanatory figures and tables supplement the text and clarify difficult concepts. Extensive references provide gateways to more focused study. Suitable for undergraduates or new practitioners interested in improving their knowledge on the current status and future trends of HPLC, the book is also a critical resource for researchers looking for solutions to complex separation problems or those who currently use HPLC either as an analytical or a preparative scale tool.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2010", "edition": "2", "publisher": "CRC Press", "language": "english", "pages": "715 / 713", "ISBN10": "1574445545", "ISBN13": "9781574445541", "file": "PDF, 9.75 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1290246", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1290246/a8e360"},

The key performance factors for a biosensor that drive the research are selectivity, sensitivity, response time, accuracy, and reproducibility, with additional requirements of its portability and inexpensive nature. These performance factors are largely governed by the materials and techniques being used in these bioanalytical platforms. The selection of materials to meet these requirements is critical, as their interaction or involvement with the biological recognition elements should initiate or improve these performance factors. The technique discussed primarily applies to transducers involved in converting a biochemical signal to optical or electrical signals. Over the years, the emergence of novel materials and techniques has drastically improved the performance of these bioanalytical systems, enabling them to expand their analytical horizon. These advanced materials and techniques are central to modern bioanalytical and biosensor research.   Advanced Materials and Techniques for Biosensors and Bioanalytical Applications provides a comprehensive review of the subject, including a knowledge platform for both academics and researchers. Considering biosensors as a central theme to this book, an outline on this subject with background principles has been included, with a scope of extending the utility of the book to coursework in graduate and postgraduate schools.

CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC, 2003. \u2013 474 p.This book began as a small series of brief articles designed to assist engineers and salesmen in understanding some aspects of ion chemistry and mass spectrometry. Each article was composed of a very short summary and a longer section that described aspects of the subject matter in somewhat greater detail. To facilitate rapid reading and assimilation, extensive use was made of figures and tables, which contain additional information in their legends or footnotes.From the outset of writing these articles, it was never intended that they should be exhaustively comprehensive, because this approach would have defeated the aims of the whole exercise, viz. , the provision of short, quick explanations of major elements of mass spectrometry and closely allied topics. The traditional, more all-embracing approach to writing about mass spectrometry was left to the many excellent authors, who have provided impressive textbooks. In contrast, the major objective of the Back-to-Basics series was the provision of quick explanations of fundamental concepts in mass spectrometry, without overelaboration. As far as possible, descriptions of processes, applications, and underlying science were made with a minimum of text backed up by easily and rapidly understood pictures. Although some major equations of relevance to mass spectrometry have been introduced, the mathematical derivations of these equations were largely omitted. This was not an attempt to dumb down an important discipline. Rather, the intent was to make some of the esoteric aspects of an important area of analysis readily comprehensible to the many people who have to deal with mass spectrometers but who have not been trained specifically in this branch of science and engineering. The series began about ten years ago and encompasses recent and past developments in mass spectrometry. However, since it is the principles of mass spectrometry that are explained and not specific instrumentation, the information content remains as relevant now as it was ten years ago.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "language": "english", "pages": "473", "file": "PDF, 26.24 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3079284", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3079284/40c5e8"},

Also, this summary account of a very large subject necessarily depends substantially on a number of more detailed articles that record the primary sources for particular areas. At the beginning of each section, these other sources are listed. The majority of the original references can be found in these; apart from exceptionally important ones, the primary references given are those not readily to be found in the other sources. The article is divided into sections. The Laying of the Foundations: The Period to 1945 covers the initial period during which sound experimental techniques and theoretical understandings were developed for molecular vibrational spectroscopy in the infrared (IR) and Raman regions. This spans the period between the discovery of the IR region of the spectrum by Sir William Herschel in 1800 and the summary of the achievements of these two principal forms of vibrational spectroscopy in the book Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy of Polyatomic Molecules written by Gerhard Herzberg and published in 1945. By the latter date, the interpretation of such spectra had become well established through the application of quantum theory.As a result of technical experimental developments during the Second World War, IR spectroscopy in particular was poised in 1945 to make new and major contributions to molecular structural analysis and to the qualitative/quantitative analysis of mixtures. This subsequent period, up to the year 2000, was marked by several major experimental advances, which are discussed in the second part of the article entitled The Period, since 1945, of Multiple Applications of the IR and Raman Spectroscopies. This period is one of which the author has had consider- able personal knowledge since starting in 1943 as a research student using IR spectroscopy for wartime research. During this period, the use of vibrational spectroscopy increased greatly decade by decade so the account given here constitutes only an introductory outline.Since the mid-1960s, several additional methods of obtaining vibrational spectra have been developed, which have important but specialized areas of application. These are described and evaluated in the third part of the article under the heading The Newer Vibrational Spectroscopies.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "language": "english", "file": "ZIP, 72.73 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3147291/dfb967"},

The Wiley Separation Science Series provides the analyst in these laboratories with well-focused books covering individual techniques, so that they can be applied more efficiently and effectively to contemporary analytical problems. The different enantiomers of a drug can exhibit widely different physiological activity in degree and nature. As a result, the separation and identification of enantiomers is now a very important analytical problem and chiral chromatography is the natural technique to apply to the resolution of such mixtures. Chiral Chromatography provides the reader with a basic understanding of the nature of chromatographic separations and relates the principles specifically to the separation of enantiomers. The following information is included:    * chiral separations involving both gas and liquid chromatography    * descriptions of the apparatus used for both techniques    * detailed discussion on the retention mechanism that results in chiral selectivity    * the structure and synthesis of a wide range of chirally active stationary phases used in both gas and liquid chromatography    * preparative applications for large scale purification of enantiomers    * applications of capillary electrophoresis and capillary electrochromatography.In addition to the above, a large number of examples of the separation of both commercially and physiologically interesting chiral mixtures are given, as is a detailed discussion on the mechanism of selectivity of each example. Thomas Beesley was founder and is the CEO for a leading manufacturer of chiral stationary phases and has published papers on TLC, HPLC and chiral separations involving cyclodextrins. He has also coauthored papers with Daniel W. Armstrong, an expert on modern cyclodextrin columns. Raymond Scott has worked in the field of separation science for over 40 years and has contributed extensively to the development of both gas and liquid chromatography publishing over 160 papers on the subjects.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "year": "1998", "edition": "1", "publisher": "J.

This is evident for all to see on the supermarket shelves, margarine is packed in polystyrene tubs, beer is packed in PVC bottles and meats and bacon in shrink-wrap film. Foods are also increasingly being shipped in bulk, in plastic containers. Additionally, there is the area of use of plastics utensils, containers and processing equipment in the home and during bulk preparation of food in producing factories, at home and in restaurants and canteens. Thus it is likely that some transfer of polymer additives will occur - adventitious impurities such as monomers, oligomers, catalyst remnants and residual polymerisation solvents and low molecular weight polymer fractions - from the plastic into the packaged material with the consequent risk of a toxic hazard to the consumer. The actual hazard arising to the consumer from any extractable material is a function of two properties, namely, the intrinsic toxicity of the extracted material as evaluated in animal feeding trials (not dealt with in this book) and the amount of material extracted from the polymer which enters the packed commodity under service conditions, i.e., during packaging operations and during the shelf life of the packaged commodity at the time of the consumption. This book covers all aspects of the migration of additives into food and gives detailed information on the analytical determination of the additives in various plastics. It will be of interest to those engaged in the implementation of packaging legislation, including management, analytical chemists and the manufacturers of foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and also scientific and toxicologists in the packaging industry.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2010", "publisher": "iSmithers Rapra Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "340", "ISBN10": "1847350577", "ISBN13": "9781847350572", "file": "PDF, 2.29 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/694383", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/694383/e008ac"},

Approximately 30,000 new journal articles are published in this area each year, spread over a wide range of health science and physical science disciplines. Navigating this literature is time-consuming and as methods diverge, it's difficult to make the right choices. Users of Comprehensive Sample and Sample Preparation can feel confident that the information collected has been carefully reviewed and vetted, which means they can save time and make sound decisions on what can be used in their own work. In its four volumes, Comprehensive Sampling and Sample Preparation contains a complete treatment of the theory and methodology of sampling in all physical phases and the theory of sample preparation for all major extraction techniques. Fundamentals of sampling and sample preparation are reinforced through broad and detailed sections dealing with Biological and Medical, Environmental and Forensic, and Food and Beverage applications. The contributions are organized to reflect the way in which analytical chemists approach a problem. It is intended for a broad audience of analytical chemists, both educators and practitioners of the art and can assist in the preparation of courses as well in the selection of sampling and sample preparation techniques to address the challenges at hand. Sampling and Sample preparation is a large and well-defined field in Analytical Chemistry, relevant for many application areas such as medicine, environmental science, biochemistry, pharmacology, geology, and food science. This work covers all these aspects and will be extremely useful to researchers and students, who can use it as a starting point to design and implement their experiments and for quality-reviewed background information. There are limited resources that Educators can use to effectively teach the fundamental aspects of modern sample preparation technology. Comprehensive Sampling and Sample Preparation addresses this need, but focuses on the common principles of new developments in extraction technologies rather than the differences between techniques thus facilitating a more thorough understanding. Provides a complete overview of the field. Not only will help to save time, it will also help to make correct assessments and avoid costly mistakes in sampling in the process. Sample and sample preparation are integral parts of the analytical process but are often less considered and sometimes even completely disregarded in the available literature. To fill this gap, leading scientists have contributed 130 chapters, organized in 4 volumes, covering all modern aspects of sampling and liquid, solid phase and membrane extractions, as well as the challenges associated with different types of matrices in relevant application areas.

Advances in optics, electronics and data handling combined\r\nwith improvements made by manufacturers and spectroscopists have made Raman\r\nscattering easier to record and more informative. Small, portable spectrometers are\r\nrugged, reliable and are becoming less expensive. Some can work powered by lowvoltage\r\n(1.5 V) batteries and give good performance in hostile environments. At the\r\nother end of the scale, advanced equipment is simpler, more sensitive, more flexible\r\nand more reliable. New methods with improved performance have been developed.\r\nAs a result, a technique which was once labelled by some as lacking sensitivity can\r\nnow, in the correct form, probe the electronic structure of a single molecule or be\r\nused to help in the diagnosis of cancer. This has attracted many more users into the\r\nfield with a wide range of backgrounds.\r\nOur aim in writing this book is to provide the understanding necessary to enable\r\nnew users to apply the technique effectively. In the early chapters we provide basic\r\ntheory and practical advice to enable the measurement and interpretation of Raman\r\nspectra with the minimum barrier to getting started. However, for those with a deeper\r\nunderstanding of the effect, Raman scattering is a very rich technique capable\r\nof providing unique information and a unique insight into specific problems. In\r\nwriting this book some difficult choices have had to be made around the presentation\r\nof the theory, particularly with the wide variety of backgrounds we expect\r\nreaders to possess. We have used as few equations as possible to show how the\r\ntheory is developed and those are deliberately placed after the chapters on basic\r\nunderstanding. We concentrate on molecular polarizability, the molecular property\r\nwhich controls intensity. The equations are explained, not derived, so that those with\r\nlittle knowledge of mathematics can understand the conclusions reached and those\r\nof a more mathematical bent can use the framework for further investigation. This\r\nenables selection rules, resonance Raman scattering and some of the language in\r\nmodern literature to be understood. This is not the traditional approach but, although\r\nderiving scattering theory from first principles is good for understanding, it adds little\r\nto Raman interpretation. Classical theory which does not use quantum mechanics\r\ncannot deliver the information required by most Raman spectroscopists. For these\r\nreasons, references to these areas are given but the theory is not explained.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "year": "2019", "edition": "2", "publisher": "Wiley", "language": "english", "pages": "248", "ISBN13": "9781119440550", "file": "PDF, 4.58 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5333373", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5333373/190b9d"},

In return, these elements have always played a prominent role in lighting devices and light conversion technologies (Auer mantles, incandescent lamps, lasers, cathode-ray and plasma displays). They are also presently used in highly sensitive luminescent bio-analyses and cell imaging. This volume of the Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths is entirely devoted to the photophysical properties of these elements. It is dedicated to the late Professor William T (Bill) Carnall who has pioneered the understanding of lanthanide spectra in the 1960's and starts with a Dedication to this scientist. The following five chapters describe various aspects of lanthanide spectroscopy and its applications. Chapters 231 presents state-of-the-art theoretical calculations of lanthanide energy levels and transition intensities. It is followed  by a review (Chapter 232) on both theoretical and experimental aspects of f-d transitions, a less well known field of lanthanide spectroscopy, yet very important for the design of new optical materials. Chapter 233 describes how confinement effects act on the photophysical properties of lanthanides when they are inserted into nanomaterials, including nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanowires, nanotubes, insulating and semiconductor nanocrystals. The use of lanthanide chelates for biomedical analyses is presented in Chapter 234; long lifetimes of the excited states of lanthanide ions allow the use of time-resolved spectroscopy, which leads to highly sensitive analyses devoid of background effect from the autofluorescence of the samples. The last review (Chapter 235) provides a comprehensive survey of near-infrared (NIR) emitting molecular probes and devices, spanning an all range of compounds, from simple chelates to macrocyclic complexes, heterometallic functional edifices, coordination polymers and other extended structures. Applications ranging from telecommunications to light-emitting diodes and biomedical analyses are assessed.                                         - Provides a comprehensive look at optical spectroscopy and its applications - A volume in the continuing authoritative series which deals with the chemistry, materials science, physics and technology of the rare earth elements", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2007", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "549", "ISBN10": "0444521445", "ISBN13": "9780444521446", "file": "PDF, 9.74 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/550109", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550109/238302"},

The Introduction to the first (1945) edition included the following paragraph: The reasons for writing this book were, firstly, the conviction that the structural side of inorganic chemistry cannot be put on a sound basis until the knowledge gained from the study of the solid state has been incorporated into chemistry as an integral part of that subject, and secondly, the equally stroing conviction that it is unsatisfactory merely to add information about the structures of solids to the descriptions of the elements and compounds as usually presented in a systematic treatment of inorganic chemistry.* Now, after a period of thirty years during which considerable advances have been made in solid state chemistry, it is still true to say that the structures and properties of solids receive very little attention in most treatments of inorganic chemistry, and this in spite of the fact that most elements and most inorganic compounds are solids at ordinary temperatures.

This approach starts with the fundamental building block of matter, the atom, and uses it as the stepping stone to understanding more complex chemistry topics. Once mastery of the nature of atoms and electrons is achieved, the formation and properties of compounds are developed. Only after the study of matter and the atom will students have sufficient background to fully engage in topics such as stoichiometry, kinetics, equilibrium, and thermodynamics. Thus, the Atoms First method empowers instructors to present the most complete and compelling story of general chemistry. Julia Burdge is renowned for setting chemistry in interesting, relevant context and for her engaging, conversational writing style - presenting chemistry in a way students can appreciate and understand while satisfying instructors requirements for rigor, accuracy, and comprehensive coverage. Jason Overby teaches general chemistry using an atoms-first approach, bringing a unique perspective and years of experience to the development of this new project. Far from a simple re-ordering of topics, this is a book that will truly meet the needs of the growing atoms-first market. Together, these authors have developed a product with the same appeal, modern and descriptive artwork, sound problem-solving approach, and wide range of end-of-chapter problems that customers have come to expect from Burdge. This textbook will offer the same engaging writing style, modern and descriptive artwork, sound problem-solving approach and wide range of end-of-chapter problems that customers are accustomed to with the Burdge product. Jason Overbys involvement with this project was crucial as he has been teaching with this approach for over four years which allowed Julia and Jason to create a product that fits the need for this growing market.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2012", "publisher": "McGraw-Hill", "language": "english", "pages": "1133", "ISBN10": "0073511161", "ISBN13": "9780073511160", "file": "PDF, 137.42 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2363577", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2363577/a050cd"},

Godovikov which reflects the latest data on communication of the chemical composition with structure and properties of minerals, conditions of their formation, their paragenesis. The following features lay its basis: a) the numerous, often not considered earlier chemical signs on which chemical properties of minerals, conditions of their formation or paragenesis may depend; b) the determined consistent patterns of communication between chemical compounds structure and fundamental properties of the elements forming them; c) regularities of structure change and properties of minerals depending on physical and chemical parameters of formation or environment systems. This systemati\u0441 considers real associations, differences in physical and chemical parameters at which minerals are forming and existing. In this systematic sometimes the preference is given to the last signs because all natural associations aren't casual in an arrangement of minerals, so they formed as a result of difficult and longtime selection. The properties of minerals are coordinated with their structure, formation conditions. The transition conditions from one taxon to another both at one level and at its deepenings are accurately formulated. The primary type of a chemical bond was accepted as leading sign of five highest taxons. The lowest taxons were allocated on: a) the mineral belongings to izodesmichesky or anizodesmichesky connections; b) the type of anion, cation; c) the coordination number of an anionoobrazovatel; d) the size of CX; e) the type of the structure. The signs which are in the basis for systematization give the chance to find the place for new mineral types in the tables, to change the place of mineral in connection with specification of its formula or structure. They also allow to distinguish new taxons for the new mineral types representing chemical compounds, earlier not known in nature. Thus this systematic is not a stiffened representation but the developing system.\n\r\nAlexander AleksandrovichGodovikov (10.04.1927. \u2013 03.07.1995).\u2013Soviet and Russian mineralogist, doctor of geol.-min. sciences, professor, the outstanding scientist in the field of theoretical, genetic, descriptive and experimental mineralogy, growth of crystals, development of studying techniques of natural and synthetic products.

Now the authors have completely revised and updated the text, including more than 2000 new literature references to work published since the first edition. No page has been left unaltered but the novel features which proved so attractive have been retained. The book presents a balanced, coherent and comprehensive account of the chemistry of the elements for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. This crucial central area of chemistry is full of ingenious experiments, intriguing compounds and exciting new discoveries. The authors specifically avoid the term `inorganic chemistry' since this evokes an outmoded view of chemistry which is no longer appropriate in the final decade of the 20th century.Accordingly, the book covers not only the 'inorganic' chemistry of the elements, but also analytical, theoretical, industrial, organometallic, bio-inorganic and other cognate areas of chemistry. The authors have broken with recent tradition in the teaching of their subject and adopted a new and highly successful approach based on descriptive chemistry. The chemistry of the elements is still discussed within the context of an underlying theoretical framework, giving cohesion and structure to the text, but at all times the chemical facts are emphasized. Students are invited to enter the exciting world of chemical phenomena with a sound knowledge and understanding of the subject, to approach experimentation with an open mind, and to assess observations reliably. This is a book that students will notonly value during their formal education, but will keep and refer to throughout their careers as chemists.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "1997", "edition": "2nd ed", "publisher": "Butterworth-Heinemann", "language": "english", "pages": "1359", "ISBN10": "0750633654", "ISBN13": "9780750633659", "file": "DJVU, 21.32 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/461292/cb7556"},

Gas-phase experiments on either neutral or ionic adducts of chiral molecules allow for the study of intrinsic properties of chiral recognition in solvent-free conditions. With contributions from a panel of international experts exploring a variety of subjects, Chiral Recognition in the Gas Phase describes the structural and energetic aspects of these interactions.  Optical spectroscopy  The first part of the book focuses on optical spectroscopy in jet-cooled conditions in neutral chiral molecules and complexes. The spectroscopic methods range from microwave, IR, and UV spectroscopy to circular dichroism effects in photoelectron spectroscopy. The book also discusses issues related to the homochirality of life.  Mass spectrometry    The second section describes mass spectrometry approaches to chiral recognition in ionic complexes. These approaches encompass the study of the stability of supramolecular chiral host-guest adducts, the study of chiral catalysts and chiral selectors, the use of small DNA sequences as auxiliaries for discriminating the enantiomers of amino-acids, and the probe of the chirality of a single amino acid within a peptide chain.    Chiral recognition on a molecular level is essential for the rational design of chiral separation media and for understanding the fundamental interactions between biological molecules. It is especially important in all of the life chemistries, particularly in pharmacology, due to the differences in behavior between the enantiomers of a chiral molecule embedded in a chiral surrounding.

It contains some hitherto unpublished results of research, as well as considerable new data derived from a careful search of all the available literature, none of which have previously appeared in book form. Although intended primarily as a college textbook, it is not entirely elementary in character and it is hoped that it will be found sufficiently complete and fundamental to be of service to the more mature student of the science. Every effort has been made to avoid the old \"cook-book\" method of presentation so common in books of this kind and to give the underlying scientific reasons for the many phenomena which occur, as well as the rationale of each process and detail of manipulation.When available, the source of what may be termed \"new information\" has been acknowledged, but this has not always been possible and the author trusts he may be pardoned for any serious omissions in this particular. Although it is hoped that in the present book all of the errors which occurred in the author's edition have been eliminated, some new ones may have crept in and the author will esteem it a favor to have these called to his attention.", "categories": "Chemistry - Analytical Chemistry", "language": "english", "pages": "275", "file": "PDF, 19.28 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3278108", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3278108/d19a9e"},

The book is intended to fill the gap between the basic thermodynamic and kinetics concepts acquired by students during their academic formation, and the use of experimental techniques such as thermal analysis and calorimetry to answer practical questions. Moreover, it supplies insights into the various thermal and calorimetric methods which can be employed in studies aimed at characterizing the physico-chemical properties of solid adsorbents, supports and catalysts, and the processes related to the adsorption desorption phenomena of the reactants and/or products of catalytic reactions.

Solids, as catalysts or as supports for other reagents, offer potential for benefit in all these areas. This monograph provides an overview of the properties of the more useful solid catalysts and supported reagents, and highlights their most valuable applications in the preparation of organic chemicals in liquid phase reactions. Clean Synthesis Using Porous Inorganic Solid Catalysts and Supported Reagents is concerned with the use of solid catalysts in the clean synthesis of organic chemicals. The emphasis is on chemical processes of importance to the manufacture/preparation of fine and speciality chemicals, chemical intermediates and pharmaceutical intermediates, especially where catalysis is not currently used or where current catalysts are homogeneous, leading to difficult separation procedures and unacceptable levels of waste.

It introduces different ways of how ions and molecules can be encapsulated by three-dimensional caging ligands to form molecular and polymeric species: covalent, supramolecular, and coordination capsules. The authors introduce their classification, reactivity, and selected practical applications. Because encapsulation can isolate caged ions and molecules from external factors, the encapsulated species can exhibit unique physical and chemical properties. The resulting specific reactivity and selectivity can open up a range of applications, including chemical separation, recognition, chiral separation, catalysis, applications as sensors or probes, as molecular or supramolecular devices, or molecular carriers (cargo).A particularly strong emphasis in this book is on the summary and review of the synthesis of various types of cage compounds. Readers will find over 850 literature references summarized and clearly represented in over 600 schemes and illustrations. The book is structured by the types of caging ligands (covalent, supramolecular, or coordination capsules). The authors further arranged the chapters by ligand classes and types of encapsulated species (neutral molecules, anions, or cations). Readers will hence find an exhaustive reference resource and summary of the current state of research into encapsulated species, nowadays almost a separated realm of modern chemistry.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2016", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer International Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "653", "ISBN13": "9783319277387", "file": "PDF, 125.11 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2741570", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2741570/dee014"},

Continuous semiconducting thin films with large carrier mobilities are particularly desirable for high-speed microelectronic applications, potentially providing new opportunities for the development of low-cost, large-area, flexible computing devices, displays, sensors, and solar cells.To date, the majority of solution-processing research has focused on molecular and polymeric organic films. In contrast, this book reviews recent achievements in the search for solution-processed inorganic semiconductors and other critical electronic components. These components offer the potential for better performance and more robust thermal and mechanical stability than comparable organic-based systems.Solution Processing of Inorganic Materials covers everything from the more traditional fields of sol-gel processing and chemical bath deposition to the cutting-edge use of nanomaterials in thin-film deposition.  In particular, the book focuses on materials and techniques that are compatible with high-throughput, low-cost, and low-temperature deposition processes such as spin coating, dip coating, printing, and stamping. Throughout the text, illustrations and examples of applications are provided to help the reader fully appreciate the concepts and opportunities involved in this exciting field.In addition to presenting the state-of-the-art research, the book offers extensive background material.

And it is assumed that this would be the case for extraterrestrial life as well. Therefore it is important to investigate where water can be found in the Universe. Although there are places that are completely dry, places where the last rainfall happened probably several 100 million years ago, surprisingly this substance is quite omnipresent. In the outer solar system the large satellites of Jupiter and Saturn are covered by a thick layer of ice that could be hiding a liquid ocean below. This of course brings up the question of whether the recently detected extrasolar planets could have some water on their surfaces and how we can detect this. Water molecules are also found in interstellar gas and dust clouds. This book begins with an introductory chapter reviewing the physical and chemical properties of water. Then it illuminates the apparent connection between water and life. This is followed by chapters dealing with our current knowledge of water in the solar system, followed by a discussion concerning the potential presence and possible detection of water on exoplanets. The signature of water in interstellar space and stars are reviewed before the origin of water in the Universe is finally discussed. The book ends with an appendix on detection methods, satellite missions and astrophysical concepts touched upon in the main parts of the book. The search for water in the Universe is related to the search for extraterrestrial life and is of fundamental importance for astrophysics, astrobiology and other related topics. This book therefore addresses students and researchers in these fields.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2011", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer Netherlands", "language": "english", "pages": "242 / 249", "ISBN10": "9048199832", "ISBN13": "9789048199839", "file": "PDF, 11.83 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/873441", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/873441/5d08b4"},

For this reason, the investigation on thermal degradation of materials is a significantly important area in research and development activities. The analysis of thermal stability can be used to assess the behavior of materials in the aggressive environmental conditions, which in turn provides valuable information about the service life span of the materiel. Unlike other books published so far that have focused on either the fundamentals of thermal analysis or the degradation pattern of the materials, this book is specifically on the mechanism of degradation of materials. The mechanism of rapturing of chemical bonds as a result of exposure to high-temperature environment is difficult to study and resulting mechanistic pathway hard to establish. Limited information is available on this subject in the published literatures and difficult to excavate. Chapters in this book are contributed by the experts working on thermal degradation and analysis of the wide variety of advanced and traditional materials. Each chapter discusses the material, its possible application, behavior of chemical entities when exposed to high-temperature environment and mode and the mechanistic route of its decomposition.

About five years ago the field began to mature, and it was felt it would be a good time to look into the possibility of publishing a series of review papers on rare-earth-containing hiTc superconductors.  In volume 31 we have ten chapters to complement the eight which appeared in print as volume 30 at the end of 2000 on the same topic. These ten chapters are concerned with the electronic structure and various chemical, physical and optical properties of the hiTc  oxides.  The first chapter is an extensive review of oxygen nonstoichiometry and lattice effects in Yba2Cu3Ox (YBCO). The next chapter concentrates on flux pinning effect which result in high critical current densities even at high temperatures and in high magnetic fields. The magnetoresistance and Hall effect in both normal and superconducting states of the cuprate superconductors are reviewed in chapter 3. The following two chapters are devoted to neutron scattering studies. And chapter 6 reviews some aspects of the low-temperature heat capacity of the ceramic oxide superconductors. The next three chapters are concerned with various spectroscopies - photoemission, infrared and Raman. Finally the tunneling spectra of the cuprate superconductors and the characterisation of these materials by scanning tunneling microscopy are discussed in chapter 10.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2001", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "629", "ISBN10": "0444507191", "ISBN13": "9780444507198", "file": "DJVU, 6.81 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550142/29e080"},

It contains three chapters dealing with rare earth alloys and intermetallic compounds.  Chapter one deals with ternary rare earth-germanium alloys, their phase diagrams and the crystal structures of the intermediate phases. In particular the group VIII metals are discussed, of which the first member of each row (iron, ruthenium and osmium) forms only half the number of compounds as the other two members, cobalt and nickel and their congeners. The author also observes that the ternary alloy systems of the rare earths and germanium with the s and p elements have hardly been investigated. The chapter ends with a discussion on the general trends and unusual features observed in the various sets of ternary phase diagrams.  Chapters two describes in detail the various structure types that have been adopted by the rare earth-germanium ternary intermetallic compounds. The correlations, crystal chemistry and interrelationships of the 135 structure types are discussed. This paper also reviews quaternary compounds and superstructures.  The final chapter deals with scandium alloys and intermetallic compounds, binary, ternary and higher order systems. The authors summarize the various phase diagrams of scandium systems and present the crystal structure properties of the various intermediate phases. The chapter finishes with a presentation of physical property data on scandium intermetallic phases. The results are divided into three groups - compounds which have a magnetic ground state, a superconducting ground state and those with neither a magnetic or a superconducting ground state.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2000", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "583", "ISBN10": "0444503420", "ISBN13": "9780444503428", "file": "DJVU, 5.61 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550133/957159"},

However, if one considers the possible true ternary compounds and possible pseudo-binary ternary alloys formed by mixing two binary compounds, there is still a wealth of knowledge to be obtained from these still-to-be discovered materials. This volume makes a start in this direction.Chapter one deals with the Fermi surfaces of rare earth (Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Yb) intermetallic compounds. It begins with an introduction to the relevant theories required to describe the electrons near the Fermi surface and then to the basic experimental techniques to study these surfaces. The main portion of the chapter is devoted to a comparison of the experimental results with the band structure calculations for a large number of compounds. Chapter two examines the world of thin films of rare earth metals, alloys and compounds. The three main topics covered are the pure metals themselves, metallic alloys and compounds, and metalloid compounds. The next chapter is devoted to hydrogen in metals and their binary compounds RH2 and RH3. One of the critical problems is the purity of the starting rare earth metal itself because phase relations can be greatly affected by impurities and attention is therefore paid to the preparation of specimens and the phase diagrams. Structural properties, kinetics and thermodynamic behavior, as well as electronic, magnetic and thermal properties are reviewed as well. Also examined is the profound influence of hydrogen on the magnetic properties by the mediation of RKKY interaction in these materials. The final chapter is an update on the magnetic behaviors of lanthanide intermetallic compounds, an area which has seen many new developments in the last 15 years. The chapter is divided into two main parts. Part one is devoted to 3d magnetism where both the 3d metal and lanthanide element contribute to the magnetic behavior, and the second part is concerned with lanthanide magnetism itself.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "1995", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "472", "ISBN10": "0444820140", "ISBN13": "9780444820143", "file": "DJVU, 5.29 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550126/f298a0"},

This is an OCR edition with typos. Excerpt from book: CHAPTER III. NORMAL COMPOUNDS OF BERYLLIUM. All normal compounds of beryllium which are soluble in water are strongly acid in reaction to litmus, dissolve notable quantities of their own hydroxide which increases in amount with the concentration of the solution, set free carbon dioxide from carbonates and attack certain metals. In short, they act in many respects like the acids themselves would act from which they are derived. In spite of these facts they show less hydrolysis, and consequent smaller concentration of hydrogen ions, at least in the case of the chloride, nitrate and sulphate, (iveys, 1899; 10 and Brunner, 1900; 1) when treated by the well-known method of sugar inversion, than the corresponding salts of iron and aluminum. By the same method of determination, the hydrogen ions are thrown back into the undissociated condition when but a small fraction of the beryllium hydroxide has been dissolved which the normal salt is capable of holding in solution, (Parsons, 1904; 10). The reasons for these phenomena are not at present understood. The sulphate has been recently studied with a view to a solution of this problem, (1907; 10) and it has been shown that the addition of beryllium hydroxide to a solution of the sulphate, raises the freezing point and diminishes the conductivity; that no beryllium enters into the formation of a complex anion and that while the hydroxide can be partially removed by dialysis if dialyzed into pure water, there is little evidence of a colloid being present. It has been suggested that we may have here a new instance of solution, wherein the solid, when once dissolved, acts as a true solvent for its own oxide or hydroxide, and there are some analogies which point strongly to this view, (1907; n). To this same cause, whatever it may be, i...", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Nabu Press", "language": "english", "pages": "185", "ISBN10": "1176540866", "ISBN13": "9781176540866", "file": "PDF, 2.95 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/557617", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/557617/fa0645"},

It comprises five chapters on the comparative physics and thermodynamics of the lanthanide and actinide materials. The first two chapters are concerned with neutron scattering studies, while the next two are concerned with physical property studies involving electronic, thermal and magnetic behaviors. The final chapter covers the thermodynamic properties of metallic systems.The first chapter compares the inelastic neutron scattering behaviours of the lanthanides and actinides. The next chapter concentrates on neutron scattering by heavy fermion single cyrstal materials, including metallic and semiconducting antiferromagnets and nearly insulating paramagnets. Chapter three, probably the most extensive and comprehensive one in the entire series, reviews intermediate valence and heavy fermions in a wide variety of lanthanide and actinide compounds, ranging from metallic to insulating materials. Chapter five focuses on two issues on the high pressure behaviors of anomalous cerium, ytterbium and uranium compounds. The final chapter is an extensive review of the thermodynamic properties of lanthanide and actinide metallic systems.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "1994", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "665", "ISBN10": "0444820159", "ISBN13": "9780444820150", "file": "DJVU, 6.92 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550140/3245a4"},

The chapters in this volume will help to unravel some of these. In the filling of the 4f electronic orbitals the lanthanides defy the elementary aufbau principle that underlies the periodic sequence of the elements, and the authors of the first chapter introduce the readers to the basic physics of the orbital collapse leading to that failure. Furthermore an explanation is offered in terms of double-well potentials. The phenomenon is illustrated using the valence transitions observed in some of the rare earth atoms, including Sm group metals and the higher oxides of cerium, praseodymium and terbium.  In the second chapter the synthesis and structure of the many types of rare earth halides are described. They have been described as simple, complex, binary, ternary and multinuclear complex, and other categories needed to deal with the most studied of the rare earth compounds. The structure types are skillfully illustrated to show the elementary architecture of each type.  In chapter three the authors discuss the science and applications of rare earth super ionic conductors as solid electrolytes. Conduction by oxygen and fluorine anions as well as hydrogen and other cations associated with these electrolytes is emphasized. They deal with extrinsic and intrinsic types together with their associated structures and structural types including structural defects. The chapter concludes with an outline of the many applications of solid electrolytes.  Chapter four introduces the reader to the principles that underlie thermoluminescence and its application to dosimetry and provides detailed information on the R-activated phosphors that support dosimetry. This is a selective review of detailed literature based on the areas making most progress.  The final chapter elaborates on the data gained by the studies and interpretation around the analytical separation of the individual rare earth elements utilizing chromatographic techniques. The authors describe the fundamental chemistry that underpins contemporary analytical separation techniques for lanthanide separation and analysis. This is done after a description of the rich assortment of separation methods in use has been introduced.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "2000", "edition": "1", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "419", "ISBN10": "0444503463", "ISBN13": "9780444503466", "file": "DJVU, 4.63 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550134/551719"},

There is no doubt that in the next breakthrough to a higher level of human understanding of nature, the rare earth elements and their compounds will play an important part in its elaboration. The reviews contained in this 26th volume continue this quest. Three of the chapters deal with various aspects of the magnetic behaviours  of the lanthanide metals and some of their compounds, while the fourth is concerned with the photoelectron spectroscopy of the anomalous f (heavy fermion) systems in cerium and uranium compounds.The first chapter presents information and results gleaned from X-ray scattering studies on the magnetic lanthanide metals, intra lanthanide alloys, a few intermetallic compounds, intra lanthanide superlayers and thin films.Chapter two is concerned with the use of static pressure and alternating mechanical stresses and their effects to study the magnetic properties of the lanthanide metals, alloys and compounds.This is followed by an examination of magnetic systems which are close to the critical conditions for the appearance of magnetic ordering. The authors note that itinerant electron metamagnetism was predicted over 35 years ago, but that the major advances were only discovered over the past decade.One of the prime research tools for understanding 4f and 5f systems is photoelectron spectroscopy and early work is this field was plagued by the lack of single crystals, the poor quality of polycrystalline samples and inadequate theories to interpret photoelectron spectra. This has however changed, and new developments are reviewed in the last chapter.", "categories": "Chemistry - Inorganic Chemistry", "year": "1999", "publisher": "North Holland", "language": "english", "pages": "422", "ISBN10": "0444501851", "ISBN13": "9780444501851", "file": "DJVU, 3.89 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550132/53dba8"},

The rich chemistry, low cost and easy availability of diesters of H-phosphonic acid makes them an excellent choice as synthone in a number of practically important reactions.Phosphonic acid esters are intermediates in the synthesis of important classes of compounds such as alpha-aminophosphonic acids, bisphosphonates, epoxyalkylphosphonates, alpha-hydroxyalkylphosphonates, phosphoramides, poly(alkylene H-phosphonate)s, poly(alkylene phosphate)s, nucleoside H-phosphonates. The synthesis of each of these compound classes is reviewed in detail.Alpha-Aminophosphonic acids are an important class of biologically active compounds, which have received an increasing amount of attention because they are considered to be structural analogues of the corresponding Alpha-amino acids. The utilities of alpha-aminophosphonates as peptide mimics, haptens of catalytic antibodies, enzyme inhibitors, inhibitors of cancers, tumours, viruses, antibiotics and pharmacologic agents are well documented. Alpha-Hydroxyalkanephosphonates are compounds of significant biological and medicinal applications. Dialkyl epoxyalkylphosphonates are of interest because of their use as intermediates in the synthesis of bioactive substances, and as modifiers of natural and synthetic polymers. Bisphosphonates are drugs that have been widely used in different bone diseases, and have recently been used successfully against many parasites. Poly(alkylene H-phosphonate)s and poly(alkylene phosphate)s are promising, biodegradable, water soluble, new polymer-carriers of drugs. Nucleoside H-phosphonates seem to be the most attractive candidates as starting materials in the chemical synthesis of DNA and RNA fragments.

It therefore forms a vital part of today's chemistry courses.    Mechanisms in Organic Reactions helps students to make sensible proposals for the mechanisms of particular organic reactions, and then how to distinguish between different possible mechanisms. Techniques for this include product studies, kinetics, and the identification of intermediates. Three chapters on intermediates discuss likely points of attack on molecules by anions, radicals and cations, and the important role of acid- and base-catalysed reactions and radical chain reactions. The prediction of reaction rates and the effects of structural changes on reaction rate are also covered.    It concludes with a discussion of molecular reactions, both thermal and photochemical - reactions which provide deep and beautiful insights into the reasons why some reactions go and others do not, and why the majority of real-life reactions involve multi-step processes.    The book provides both illuminating insights into fundamental chemistry, and also practical value for students who will go on to teach, research, or be involved in other scientific roles (administration, policy making or journalism).    Ideal for the needs of undergraduate chemistry students, Tutorial Chemistry Texts is a major series consisting of short, single topic or modular texts concentrating on the fundamental areas of chemistry taught in undergraduate science courses.

Grossman", "Peer Kirsch", "Robert B. Grossman"], "rating": "0", "description": "Intended for students of intermediate organic chemistry, this text shows how to write a reasonable mechanism for an organic chemical transformation. The discussion is organized by types of mechanisms and the conditions under which the reaction is executed, rather than by the overall reaction as is the case in most textbooks. The treatment emphasizes unifying principles, showing how common mechanisms link seemingly disparate reactions. Each chapter discusses common mechanistic pathways and suggests practical tips for drawing them. Worked problems are included in the discussion of each mechanism, and \"common error alerts\" are scattered throughout the text to warn readers about pitfalls and misconceptions that bedevil students. Each chapter is capped by a large problem set. The author has drawn on his own research and the current literature to ensure that appropriate attention is given to topics across the range of modern organic chemistry. The text is unique in its inclusion of a chapter on reactions mediated or catalyzed by transition metals, an area in which mechanistic understanding is now essential. Relatively new topics such as olefin metathesis and cycloaromatization are covered without giving short shrift to more traditional areas such as carbonyl chemistry. The text assumes a basic knowledge of organic chemistry. It can be used either in a formal course or by students working on their own, and will be particularly useful for graduate students studying for qualifying examinations. It will also be useful to students and researchers in biochemistry, pharmacology, and inorganic chemistry.     FROM THE REVIEWS:    \"... Grossman's book differs from others in the scale of the worked examples. The number of problems incorporated into the text is extraordinary. The author provides the student a Web site that includes the detailed mechanisms for every problem in the book, each of which includes explanation and commentary, and the answer set, when printed, exceeds 250 pages! . . . In style, The Art of... is unique in that it does not read like a typical textbook. Instead, the feel is like that of having a personal tutor next to you walking you through the chemistry in a step-by-step fashion. The writing is clear, concise, engaging, and, at times, outright entertaining. The lively style includes \"Common Error Alerts\" that teach students what not to do and includes tips and advice on how to solve problems . . . The highest compliment a reviewer can give is to adopt the text that he reviews. The next advanced course I teach will use The Art of Writing Reasonable Reaction Mechanisms with the goal that students will be able to posit a plausible mechanism for any new reaction that they encounter. To those of you who have taught traditional physical organic chemistry out of the classic texts, I ask you to consider trying something, well... completely different. The Art of Writing Reasonable Reaction Mechanisms might just change the way you do things.\"  - R.W. Holman, Journal of Chemical Education    SOME PRAISE FOR THE PREVIOUS EDITION:    This is an excellent and well-presented work.... The author ... has succeeded well in treating the central ideas of reactivity and selectivity in an integrated whole. The clear style of writing, the well chosen examples, and the ... concise summaries of the main points provided at the end of each chapter should enable the reader to easily consolidate what has been learned.... The book is indeed a little work of art.  - Jens Hartung, Angewandte Chemie International Edition    I have taught a one-credit course with this book for three years, and, uniformly, the students have rated this book highly for its clarity and for the scope of the problems. ... This book does an excellent job at its stated goal: \"to teach students to come up with reasonable mechanisms for reactions they have never seen before.\"  - Amy Howell, Synthesis    I have just finished my first year of graduate studies in organic chemistry at Duke University. I just wanted to let you know how much your book got me through the past year of course work.... When it came to mechanisms, I found the clarity and thoroughness I needed only in your book. It was impressive how you were able to present so much information in a clear and comprehensive manner yet keep the book so manageable in size. In addition to the text, I also was able to benefit from the problems.... Great practice!! The on-line answers are much better than looking up answers by reference....

Investigation of Organic Reactions and their Mechanisms will serve as a guide for the trained chemist who needs to characterise an organic chemical reaction and investigate its mechanism, but who is not an expert in physical organic chemistry.\nSuch an investigation will lead to an understanding of which bonds are broken, which are made, and the order in which these processes happen. This information and knowledge of the associated kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are central to the development of safe, efficient, and profitable industrial chemical processes, and to extending the synthetic utility of new chemical reactions in chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, and academic environments.\nWritten as a coherent account of the principal methods currently used in mechanistic investigations, at a level accessible to academic researchers and graduate chemists in industry, the book is highly practical in approach. The contributing authors, an international group of expert practitioners of the techniques covered, illustrate their contributions by examples from their own research and from the relevant wider chemical literature. The book covers basic aspects such as product analysis, kinetics, catalysis, and investigation of reactive intermediates.

In the course of these multi-step reaction sequences, short-lived intermediates can be generated that quickly convert into other intermediates, reactants, products or side products. As these intermediates are highly reactive, they cannot usually be isolated, but their existence and structure can be proved by theoretical and experimental methods. Using the information obtained, researchers can better understand the underlying reaction mechanism of a certain organic transformation and thus develop novel strategies for efficient organic synthesis.  The chapters are clearly structured and are arranged according to the type of intermediate, providing information on the formation, characterization, stereochemistry, stability, and reactivity of the intermediates. Additionally, representative examples and a problem section with different levels of difficulty are included for self-testing the newly acquired knowledge.  By providing a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, this is a musthave reference for PhD and Master Students in organic chemistry, as well as a valuable source of information for chemists in academia and industry working in the field.

Comprising a comprehensive set of principles for explaining chemical reactivity, orbital interaction theory originates in a rigorous theory of electronic structure that also provides the basis for the powerful computational models and techniques with which chemists seek to describe and exploit the structures and thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of molecules. Orbital Interaction Theory of Organic Chemistry, Second Edition introduces students to the fascinating world of organic chemistry at the mechanistic level with a thoroughly self-contained, well-integrated exposition of orbital interaction theory and its applications in modern organic chemistry. Professor Rauk reviews the concepts of symmetry and orbital theory, and explains reactivity in common functional groups and reactive intermediates in terms of orbital interaction theory. Aided by numerous examples and worked problems, he guides readers through basic chemistry concepts, such as acid and base strength, nucleophilicity, electrophilicity, and thermal stability (in terms of orbital interactions), and describes various computational models for describing those interactions. Updated and expanded, this latest edition of Orbital Interaction Theory of Organic Chemistry includes a completely new chapter on organometallics, increased coverage of density functional theory, many new application examples, and worked problems. The text is complemented by an interactive computer program that displays orbitals graphically and is available through a link to a Web site. Orbital Interaction Theory of Organic Chemistry, Second Edition is an excellent text for advanced-level undergraduate and graduate students in organic chemistry.

The material in Part A is organized on the basis of fundamental structural topics such as structure, stereochemistry, conformation and aromaticity and basic mechanistic types, including nucleophilic substitution, addition reactions, carbonyl chemistry, aromatic substitution and free radical reactions. The material in Part B is organized on the basis of reaction type with emphasis on reactions of importance in laboratory synthesis.

Part A emphasizes quantitative and qualitative description of structural effects on reactivity and mechanism. Part B emphasizes the most general and useful synthetic reactions.

Besides students, this has also been the requirement of teachers teaching advanced mechanistic organic chemistry.Till about 1959 there appears to be the only book by E.S. Gould (Structure and Mechanism of Organic Chemistry) but the examples mentioned in it are so difficult at several places that they elude the comprehension of even teachers, not to talk of students. Around sixties appeared the book by Jerry March (Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanism and Structure). It was definitely a much better advance than that of Gould, but it has been made so bulky that its cost has become prohibitive. It adores the racks and shelves of libraries. In view of the above difficulties of teacher and students, the present book has been brought out.Some of its special chapters are the Pericyclic Reactions, which includes Cheletropic, Electrocyclic, sigmatropic and cycloaddition reactions. The concept of stereochemistry and conformation deserve special attention not because they cater to the needs of higher students, but they are immensely useful for candidates trying for UGC and CSIR sponsored competitive examinations, but also those preparing for Union Public Service Commission and State Public Service Commission Exams. The candidates will find the chapters immensely useful and is sure to rouse interest in them in knowing more about mechanistic chemistry.Spectroscopy is another topic, a good knowledge of which is expected from any good chemist. The spectroscopy finds immense applications in the identification of several unknown compounds in the field of research and medicine. Here one has to be very careful in elucidating the correct structure of entities. Moreover, in every examination (Competitive or regular) one has to show his skill in the area of spectroscopy and therefore chapters on spectroscopy giving a clear and lucid account is also noteworthy.", "categories": "Chemistry - Organic Chemistry", "year": "2008", "publisher": "New Age International", "language": "english", "pages": "336 / 334", "ISBN10": "8122426476", "ISBN13": "9788122426472", "file": "PDF, 1.56 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/818604", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/818604/e6720d"},

The material is presented in four sections. The first section considers functional groups involving C-X bonds such as alkyl halides, alcohols, ethers and amines. The second section considers unsymmetrical p=bonded C=X functional groups, typically the carbonyl group and the influence of these groups on adjacent centres. The third section covers symmetrical p-bonded functional groups including alkenes, alkynes and arenes and the consequences of the factors that perturb the symmetry, such as on the orientation of aromatic substitution. The final section concentrates on interconversions like oxidation and reduction, and the protection of functional groups to achieve selectivity. The chemistry of the functional groups is considered here with mechanistic rationale.  Students will be encouraged to consider reactions in terms of regions of electron deficiency and excess, and hence identify the sites at which electrophiles and nucleophiles might react.", "categories": "Chemistry - Organic Chemistry", "year": "2001", "publisher": "Royal Society of Chemistry", "language": "english", "pages": "176", "ISBN10": "0854046275", "ISBN13": "9780854046270", "file": "PDF, 21.75 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/593167", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/593167/c0e30a"},

With this approach a chemist will start with the structure of their target molecule and progressively cut bonds to create simpler molecules. Reversing this process gives a synthetic route to the target molecule from simpler starting materials. This \u201cdisconnection\u201d approach to synthesis is now a fundamental part of every organic synthesis course. Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach, 2nd Edition   introduces this important technique, to help students to design their own organic syntheses. There are forty chapters: those on the synthesis of given types of molecules alternate with strategy chapters in which the methods just learnt are placed in a wider context. The synthesis chapters cover many ways of making each type of molecule starting with simple aromatic and aliphatic compounds with one functional group and progressing to molecules with many functional groups. The strategy chapters cover questions of selectivity, protection, stereochemistry, and develop more advanced thinking via reagents specifically designed for difficult problems.Examples are drawn from pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products, pheromones, perfumery and flavouring compounds, dyestuffs, monomers, and intermediates used in more advanced synthetic work. Reasons for wishing to synthesise each compound are given.This second edition has been fully revised and updated with a modern look. Recent examples and techniques are included and illustrated additional material has been added to take the student to the level required by the sequel, \u201cOrganic Synthesis: Strategy and Control\u201d.Several chapters contain extensive new material based on courses that the authors give to chemists in the pharmaceutical industry.

Grossman", "Robert B. Grossman", "Mark M. Green", "R. J. M. Nolte", "E. W. Meijer", "Scott E. Denmark", "Jay Siegel"], "rating": "0", "description": "Intended for students of intermediate organic chemistry, this text shows how to write a reasonable mechanism for an organic chemical transformation. The discussion is organized by types of mechanisms and the conditions under which the reaction is executed, rather than by the overall reaction as is the case in most textbooks. The treatment emphasizes unifying principles, showing how common mechanisms link seemingly disparate reactions. Each chapter discusses common mechanistic pathways and suggests practical tips for drawing them. Worked problems are included in the discussion of each mechanism, and \"common error alerts\" are scattered throughout the text to warn readers about pitfalls and misconceptions that bedevil students. Each chapter is capped by a large problem set. The author has drawn on his own research and the current literature to ensure that appropriate attention is given to topics across the range of modern organic chemistry. The text is unique in its inclusion of a chapter on reactions mediated or catalyzed by transition metals, an area in which mechanistic understanding is now essential. Relatively new topics such as olefin metathesis and cycloaromatization are covered without giving short shrift to more traditional areas such as carbonyl chemistry. The text assumes a basic knowledge of organic chemistry. It can be used either in a formal course or by students working on their own, and will be particularly useful for graduate students studying for qualifying examinations. It will also be useful to students and researchers in biochemistry, pharmacology, and inorganic chemistry.\nFROM THE REVIEWS:\n\"... Grossman's book differs from others in the scale of the worked examples. The number of problems incorporated into the text is extraordinary. The author provides the student a Web site that includes the detailed mechanisms for every problem in the book, each of which includes explanation and commentary, and the answer set, when printed, exceeds 250 pages! . . . In style, The Art of... is unique in that it does not read like a typical textbook. Instead, the feel is like that of having a personal tutor next to you walking you through the chemistry in a step-by-step fashion. The writing is clear, concise, engaging, and, at times, outright entertaining. The lively style includes \"Common Error Alerts\" that teach students what not to do and includes tips and advice on how to solve problems . . . The highest compliment a reviewer can give is to adopt the text that he reviews. The next advanced course I teach will use The Art of Writing Reasonable Reaction Mechanisms with the goal that students will be able to posit a plausible mechanism for any new reaction that they encounter. To those of you who have taught traditional physical organic chemistry out of the classic texts, I ask you to consider trying something, well... completely different. The Art of Writing Reasonable Reaction Mechanisms might just change the way you do things.\" - R.W. Holman, Journal of Chemical Education\nSOME PRAISE FOR THE PREVIOUS EDITION:\nThis is an excellent and well-presented work.... The author ... has succeeded well in treating the central ideas of reactivity and selectivity in an integrated whole. The clear style of writing, the well chosen examples, and the ... concise summaries of the main points provided at the end of each chapter should enable the reader to easily consolidate what has been learned.... The book is indeed a little work of art. - Jens Hartung, Angewandte Chemie International Edition\nI have taught a one-credit course with this book for three years, and, uniformly, the students have rated this book highly for its clarity and for the scope of the problems. ... This book does an excellent job at its stated goal: \"to teach students to come up with reasonable mechanisms for reactions they have never seen before.\" - Amy Howell, Synthesis\nI have just finished my first year of graduate studies in organic chemistry at Duke University. I just wanted to let you know how much your book got me through the past year of course work.... When it came to mechanisms, I found the clarity and thoroughness I needed only in your book. It was impressive how you were able to present so much information in a clear and comprehensive manner yet keep the book so manageable in size. In addition to the text, I also was able to benefit from the problems.... Great practice!! The on-line answers are much better than looking up answers by reference....

Organic synthesis is central to achieving these goals.  Comprehensive Organic Synthesis draws together the common themes that underlie the many apparently disparate areas of organic chemistry which underpin synthetic strategies, thus providing a comprehensive overview of this important discipline. The contributions have been organized to reflect the way in which synthetic chemists approach a problem. In terms of organic molecules, the work is divided into formation of carbon-carbon bonds, introduction of heteroatoms and heteroatom interconversions. Thus, Volumes 1-5 focus on carbon-carbon formation, but also include aspects of heteroatom introduction. Volumes 6-8 concentrate on interconversion of heteroatoms, but also deal with exchange of carbon-carbon bonds for carbon-heteroatom bonds. Organization of the chapters is along the theme of selectivity, which is a critical question in determining the suitability of a synthetic method. Volume 9 contains cumulative author and subject indexes.  Comprehensive Organic Synthesis  will appeal to a wide audience. The set will be an essential reference work for all those seeking information on the solution of synthetic problems, whether they be experienced practitioners or chemists whose major interests lie outside organic synthesis. In addition, synthetic chemists requiring the essential facts in new areas, as well as students completely new to the field, will find  Comprehensive Organic Synthesis  an invaluable source, providing authoritative accounts of the essential facts and concepts.", "categories": "Chemistry - Organic Chemistry", "year": "1991", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Pergamon", "language": "english", "pages": "10400 / 987", "ISBN10": "0080359299", "ISBN13": "9780080405926", "file": "PDF, 21.38 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/550636", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/550636/85e8f5"},

The material is organized according to organic functional groups, in parallel with the approach adopted in most general textbooks on organic chemistry. In this respect it differs from many of the existing, older organic photochemistry texts. The first chapter provides an account of the distinctive features of photochemical reactions, and a physical/mechanistic framework for the descriptions in the rest of the book. The overall emphasis is on organic photoreactions potentially useful in synthesis.

More and more, selective reagents are used for chemical transformations and the choice of the solvent may be determining for reaching high reaction rates and high selectivities. The toxicity and recycling considerations have also greatly influenced the nature of the solvents used for industrial reactions. Thus, the development of reactions in water is not only important on the laboratory scale but also for industrial applications. The p- formance of metal-catalyzed reactions in water for example has led to several new hydrogenation or hydroformylation procedures with important industrial applications. The various aspects of organic chemistry in water will be prese- ed in this book. Recently, novel reaction media such as perfluorinated solvents or supercritical carbon dioxide has proven to have unique advantages leading to more practical and more efficient reactions. Especially with perfluorinated solvents, new biphasic catalyses and novel approaches to perform organic reactions have been developed. These aspects will be examined in detail in this volume. Finally, the performance of reactions in the absence of solvents will show practical alternatives for many reactions. More than ever before, the choice of the solvent or the solvent system is ess- tial for realizing many chemical transformations with the highest efficiency.

Each chapter contains numerous examples demonstrating the methods and strategies that apply mainstream organic chemistry to the chemical modification of sugars. The book first describes the discovery, development, and impact of carbohydrates, followed by a discussion of protecting group strategies, glycosylation techniques, and oligosaccharide syntheses. Several chapters focus on reactions that convert sugars and carbohydrates to non-carbohydrate molecules including the substitution of sugar hydroxyl groups to new groups of synthetic or biological interest, cyclitols and carbasugars, as well as endocyclic heteroatom substitutions. Subsequent chapters demonstrate the use of sugars in chiral catalysis, their roles as convenient starting materials for complex syntheses involving multiple stereogenic centers, and syntheses for monosaccharides. The final chapters focus on new and emerging technologies, including approaches to combinatorial carbohydrate chemistry, the biological importance and chemical synthesis of glycopeptides, and the medicinally significant concept of glycomimetics.

Working somewhat independently of each other, these disciplines have guided research for decades, but they are now being combined efficiently into one unified strategy.Molecular Structure delivers the essential fundamentals on both the experimental and computational methods, then goes further to show how these approaches can join forces to produce more effective analysis of the structure and properties of organic compounds by:Looking at experimental structures: electron, neutron, X-ray diffraction, and microwave spectroscopy as well as computational structures: ab initio, semi-empirical molecular orbital, and molecular mechanics calculationsDiscussing various electronic effects, particularly stereoelectronic effects, including hyperconjugation, negative hyperconjugation, the Bohlmann and anomeric effects, and how and why these cause changes in structures and properties of moleculesIllustrating complex carbohydrate effects such as the gauche effect, the delta-two effect, and the external anomeric torsional effectCovering hydrogen bonding, the CH bond, and how energies, especially heats of formation, can be affectedUsing molecular mechanics to tie all of these things together in the familiar language of the organic chemist, valence bond picturesAuthored by a founding father of computational chemistry, Molecular Structure broadens the scope of the subject by serving as a pioneering guide for workers in the fields of organic, biological, and computational chemistry, as they explore new possibilities to advance their discoveries.

That sort of thing will not be found in this book. This is not to say it will be uninteresting to organic chemists since it deals with some exciting current topics in natural products and synthetic organic chemistry.This slim, nicely bound volume consists of a series of well-organized and up-to-date chapters by several young Japanese chemists, many of them at Tohoku University in Sendai, who specialize in marine natural products. The overall theme of this volume can be stated to be total synthesis, as five of the eight chapters deal with this topic... As is pointed out in the Preface to the series, 50% of all molecules listed in Chemical Abstracts can be considered heterocyclic, and since heterocycles are, if anything, even more common among marine natural products, one has to set limits. Because of this, some of the more important heterocyclic marine natural products such as diazonamide A, the cephalostatins, spongistatin 1, or salinosporamide A are not even mentioned in this book. Nevertheless, this book represents a valuable and timely resource, which is expected to be especially useful to graduate students, and should be included in all scientific libraries.\" (Jos\u00e9-Luis Giner, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 129 (15), 2007)", "categories": "Chemistry - Organic Chemistry", "year": "2006", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg", "language": "english", "pages": "287 / 238", "ISBN10": "3642070280", "ISBN13": "9783642070280", "file": "PDF, 11.40 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

The material has been divided such that the first volume is dedicated to 5-membered fluorinated heterocycles and macrocycles, while the second volume combines data connected with the chemistry of fluorine containing 6-membered heterocycles. Both volumes will be of interest to synthetic organic chemists in general, and particularly for those colleagues working in the fields of heterocyclic-compound chemistry, materials chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and fluorine chemistry. All information is presented and classified clearly to be effective source for broad auditory of chemists. It will be interesting for scientists working in the field of inorganic and coordination chemistry. Fluorinated heterocycles are becoming increasingly important in many areas including the pharmaceutical industry, materials science and agriculture. The presence of fluorine can result in substantial functional changes in the biological as well as physicochemical properties of organic compounds. Incorporation of fluorine into drug molecules can greatly affect their physicochemical properties, such as bond strength, lipophilicity, bioavailability, conformation, electrostatic potential, dipole moment, pKa etc. as well as pharmacokinetic properties, such as tissue distribution, rate of metabolism and pharmacological properties, such as pharmacodynamics and toxicology.", "categories": "Chemistry - Organic Chemistry", "year": "2014", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer International Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "681 / 682", "ISBN13": "9783319043463", "file": "PDF, 54.86 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2465247", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2465247/81c42f"},

Gribble", "Antti Saaksvuori", "Anselmi Immonen", "Stephan Habscheid", "Clemens Knobloch"], "rating": "0", "description": "Palladium chemistry, despite its immaturity, has rapidly become an indispensable tool for synthetic organic chemists.  Heterocycles are of paramount importance in the pharmaceutical industry and palladium chemistry is one of the most novel and efficient ways of making heterocycles. Today, palladium-catalyzed coupling is the method of choice for the synthesis of a wide range of biaryls and heterobiaryls.  The number of applications of palladium chemistry to the syntheses of heterocycles has grown exponentially.  These developments highlight the need for a monograph dedicated solely to the palladium chemistry in heterocycles and this book provides a comprehensive explanation of the subject. The principal aim of the book is to highlight important palladium-mediated reactions of heterocycles with emphasis on the unique characteristics of individual heterocycles.   1. Palladium chemistry of heterocycles has its \"idiosyncrasies\" stemming from their different structural properties from the corresponding carbocyclic aryl compounds. Even activated chloroheterocycles are sufficiently reactive to undergo Pd-catalyzed reactions. As a consequence of &agr and &bgr activation of heteroaryl halides, Pd-catalyzed chemistry may take place regioselectively at the activated positions, a phenomenon rarely seen in carbocyclic aryl halides. In addition, another salient peculiarity in palladium chemistry of heterocycles is the so-called \"heteroaryl Heck reaction\". For instance, while intermolecular palladium-catalyzed arylations of carbocyclic arenes are rare, palladium-catalyzed arylations of azoles and many other heterocycles readily take place. Therefore, the principal aim of this book is to highlight important palladium-mediated reactions of heterocycles with emphasis on the unique characteristics of individual heterocycles.  2. A myriad of heterocycles are biologically active and therefore of paramount importance to medicinal and agricultural chemists. Many heterocycle-containing natural products (they are highlighted in boxes throughout the text) have elicited great interest from both academic and industrial research groups.  Recognizing the similarities between the palladium chemistry of arenes and heteroarenes, a critical survey of the accomplishments in heterocyclic chemistry will keep readers abreast of such a fast-growing field.  We also hope this book will spur more interest and inspire ideas in such an extremely useful area.  This book comprises a compilation of important preparations of heteroaryl halides, boranes and stannanes for each heterocycle.  The large body of data regarding palladium-mediated polymerization of heterocycles in material chemistry is not focused here; neither is coordination chemistry involving palladium and heterocycles.  Many heterocycle-containing natural products (highlighted throughout the text) have elicited great interest from both academic and industrial research groups.  Recognizing the similarities between the palladium chemistry of arenes and heteroarenes, a critical survey of the accomplishments in heterocyclic chemistry keeps readers abreast of this fast-growing field.  It is also hoped that this book will stimulate more interest and inspire new ideas in this exciting area.                                       - Contains the most up-to-date developments in this fast-moving field- Includes 3 new chapters- Incorporates material from selected well-respected authors on heterocyclic chemistry", "categories": "Chemistry - Organic Chemistry", "year": "2006", "edition": "2", "publisher": "Elsevier Science", "language": "english", "pages": "659", "ISBN10": "0080451160", "ISBN13": "9780080451169", "file": "PDF, 12.44 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/853800", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/853800/32552a"},

The technology, from a resource to a knowledge-intensive based industry, investigates a new synthesis approach employing electromagnetic induction and nano-catalyst at lower energy consumption. This clean and green method for a sustainable future might change the landscape of future chemical processes. It is made possible due to the enhancement in nanotechnology where quantum mechanical understanding is called into play. New reactor designs are elaborated on and discussed explicitly. Hematite and nickel oxide nanocatalysts are proposed for the green urea synthesis process, in the presence of static and oscillating magnetic fields. Strategies to increase single to triplet conversion rate are given for better understanding of the improved urea rate. The focus is deliberately on scrutinizing the greenhouse gas effect on the urea yield, in this case CO2 flow rate. Coating techniques for slow release strategies are provided to reduce the volatilization of ammonia and leaching effect, hence offering a complete solution of Green Technology. Agriculture 4.0 that creates the new patterns and precision monitoring of crop rotation and livestock utilization will be able to pave the way for better crop yield. Development of advanced technology in agriculture is important for the implementation of Agriculture 4.0 and currently an inevitable trend of the socioeconomic development in the context of broader international integration for the sustainable future.\n\r\nThe author would like to acknowledge Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) for the grant worth RM 12 million to accomplish Green and Economical Urea project and to have full understanding on Green Technology in Urea.

The edge state is as narrow as 0.8 nm, making it extremely attractive to device physics.

This textbook takes an interdisciplinary approach to the subject and is therefore suitable for undergraduates in all those courses. The book is an introduction to phenomenological thermodynamics and its applications to phase transitions and chemical reactions, with some references to statistical mechanics. It strikes the balance between the rigorousness of the Callen text and phenomenological approach of the Atkins text. The book is divided in three parts. The first introduces the postulates and laws of thermodynamics and complements these initial explanations with practical examples. The second part is devoted to applications of thermodynamics to phase transitions in pure substances and mixtures. The third part covers thermodynamic systems in which chemical reactionstake place. There are some sections on more advanced topics such as thermodynamic potentials, natural variables, non-ideal mixtures and electrochemical reactions, which make this book of suitable also to post-graduate students.Robert Ho\u0142yst (1963) is a professor at the Institute of Physical Chemistry Polish Academy of Sciences.

G. DONNAN THE importance of an accurate study of the actions, equilibria, and structures which occur at . the interfaces between homo geneous phases of matter is widely recognised at the present time. Thus a knowledge of these matters is required for a proper under standing of adsorption, the formation and stability of disperse or micro-heterogeneous systems colloid sols and gels, catalysis, enzyme actions, etc., whilst the progress of research shows more and more clearly that the phenomena of life, i. e. the behaviour of cells and tissues, are intimately concerned with the actions occurring at surfaces, and that the effects produced by drugs, disinfectants, and other substances which profoundly affect the operation of cells and micro-organisms are largely due to surface actions. From the general statistical and thermodynamic point of view, the scientific theory of surface phenomena was placed on a satisfactory basis by the researches of J. Willard Gibbs, Sir J. J. Thomson, and J. I, van der Waals. In comparatively recent times the more in timate molecular study of the structures and kinetics of surfaces has advanced very rapidly, thanks, more especially to the pioneer work of Lord Eayleigh, Andre . Marcelin, Sir W. B. Hardy and Irving Langmuir. Our knowledge of this subject has been greatly increased during the last few years by the excellent work of N. Adam and of E. K. Rideal. The combined effect of these researches has been to reveal the existence of a newly recognised so-called two dimensional molecular world, the dynamics of which is analogous to that of the ordinary three dimensional molecular world of homogeneous phases in bulk, whilst the structure of this surface world presents new phenomena of molecular orientation of the highest importance for the understanding of great regions of natural phenomena. The great merit of Dr E. K. Rideals book lies in the fact that the author, whilst in no wise neglecting the thermodynamic treatment and its results, gives a very admirable account of this more recent and extremely important field of study. VI PREFACE Since this is also the most promising line of advance in the in vestigation of disperse systems, Dr Kideals book can be most warmly recommended to all who are interested in colloid physics and chemistry. In the last two chapters the author gives a good introduction to the principal facts and theories of what is usually understood to-day as colloid chemistry, so that the reader is fully supplied with everything that is necessary for a thorough under standing of this subject. Every student and investigator of surface and colloid phenomena owes Dr Rideal a warm debt of gratitude for his admirable survey and presentation of a great and rapidly advancing field of physico-chemical science. F. G. D. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON. April, 1926. INTEODUOTION essential differences between the properties of matter when JL in bulk and in the colloidal state were first described by Thomas Graham. The study of colloid chemistry involves a consideration of the form and behaviour of a new phase, the interfacial phase, possessing unique properties. In many systems reactions both physical and chemical are observed which may be attributed to both bulk and interfacial phases. Thus for a proper understanding of colloidal behaviour a knowledge of the properties of surfaces and reactions at interfaces is evidently desirable. Whilst the conditions of equilibrium for such systems were clearly enunciated by J. Willard Gibbs and Sir J.

The development can be characterized by a revolution in fundamental knowledge obtained from simple model systems and by an explosion in the number of experimental techniques. The last 10 years has seen an equally rapid development of quantum mechanical modeling of surface processes using Density Functional Theory (DFT).  Chemical Bonding at Surfaces and Interfaces  focuses on phenomena and concepts rather than on experimental or theoretical techniques. The aim is to provide the common basis for describing the interaction of atoms and molecules with surfaces and this to be used very broadly in science and technology.  The book begins with an overview of structural information on surface adsorbates and discusses the structure of a number of important chemisorption systems. Chapter 2 describes in detail the chemical bond between atoms or molecules and a metal surface in the observed surface structures. A detailed description of experimental information on the dynamics of bond-formation and bond-breaking at surfaces make up Chapter 3. Followed by an in-depth analysis of aspects of heterogeneous catalysis based on the d-band model. In Chapter 5 adsorption and chemistry on the enormously important Si and Ge semiconductor surfaces are covered. In the remaining two Chapters the book moves on from solid-gas interfaces and looks at solid-liquid interface processes.

Hydrogen has shocked, it has surprised, it has embarrassed, it has humbled--and again and again it has guided physicists to the edge of new vistas where the promise of basic understanding and momentous insights beckoned. The allure of hydrogen, crucial to life and critical to scientific discovery, is at the center of this book, which tells a story that begins with the big bang and continues to unfold today.    In this biography of hydrogen, John Rigden shows how this singular atom, the most abundant in the universe, has helped unify our understanding of the material world from the smallest scale, the elementary particles, to the largest, the universe itself. It is a tale of startling discoveries and dazzling practical benefits spanning more than one hundred years--from the first attempt to identify the basic building block of atoms in the mid-nineteenth century to the discovery of the Bose-Einstein condensate only a few years ago. With Rigden as an expert and engaging guide, we see how hydrogen captured the imagination of many great scientists--such as Heisenberg, Pauli, Schr\u0413\u00b6dinger, Dirac, and Rabi--and how their theories and experiments with this simple atom led to such complex technical innovations as magnetic resonance imaging, the maser clock, and global positioning systems. Along the way, we witness the transformation of science from an endeavor of inspired individuals to a monumental enterprise often requiring the cooperation of hundreds of scientists around the world.    Still, any biography of hydrogen has to end with a question: What new surprises await us?

This growth has also led to attention being focused on somewhat more basic studies of the science of adhesion and adhesives, and in recent years our level of fundamental knowledge concerning the formation and mechanical performance of adhesive joints has increased dramatically. Such studies have, of course, been aided greatly by the development of the tools at the disposal of the investigators. For example, specific surface analytical techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron and secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, and the increasingly sophisticated methods of stress analysis and fracture mechanics have been put to good use in furthering our understanding of the science of adhesion and adhesives. The present book attempts to review the multidisciplined subject of adhesion and adhesives, considering both the science and technology involved in the formation and mechanical performance of adhesive joints.

From early days it was apparent that hydrogenosomes had evolved on multiple occasions in different eukaryotes, but from which progenitor organelle or endosymbiont was unresolved. Work from many different laboratories has contributed towards formulating the current hypothesis that hydrogenosomes and mitosomes, their even more reduced cousins, share common ancestry with mitochondria. Their shared similarities, for example their common mechanisms of protein import and their double membrane, can be explained by common ancestry, and their differences by descent with modification under contrasting lifestyles. The hypothesis that mitochondria, mitosomes and hydrogenosomes are homologues, predicts that, as the organelles are studied more deeply, additional shared features will be revealed. However, it is already apparent from the contributions to this volume, that identifying the genetic contribution to eukaryotes of the mitochondrial endosymbiosis, and revealing the functions of its descendent organelles, are key to understanding eukaryotic biology and evolution.", "categories": "Chemistry - Physical Chemistry", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer", "language": "english", "pages": "313", "ISBN10": "3540385010", "ISBN13": "9783540385011", "file": "PDF, 4.01 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

The particles are either naturally present or engineered into these systems. In either case these particles often significantly affect the behavior of such systems. This book provides a framework for analyzing these dispersed phase systems and describes how to synthesize the behavior of the population particles and their environment from the behavior of single particles in their local environments.\nPopulation balances are of key relevance to a very diverse group of scientists, including astrophysicists, high-energy physicists, geophysicists, colloid chemists, biophysicists, materials scientists, chemical engineers, and meteorologists. Chemical engineers have put population balances to most use, with applications in the areas of crystallization; gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, and solid-liquid dispersions; liquid membrane systems; fluidized bed reactors; aerosol reactors; and microbial cultures.\nRamkrishna provides a clear and general treatment of population balances with emphasis on their wide range of applicability. New insight into population balance models incorporating random particle growth, dynamic morphological structure, and complex multivariate formulations with a clear exposition of their mathematical derivation is presented. Population Balances provides the only available treatment of the solution of inverse problems essential for identification of population balance models for breakage and aggregation processes, particle nucleation, growth processes, and more. This book is especially useful for process engineers interested in the simulation and control of particulate systems. Additionally, comprehensive treatment of the stochastic formulation of small systems provides for the modeling of stochastic systems with promising new areas of applications such as the design of sterilization systems and radiation treatment of cancerous tumors.\nOutstanding features:\nA clear and general treatment of population balances with emphasis on their wide range of applicability. Thus all processes involving solid-fluid and liquid-liquid dispersions, biological populations, etc. are encompassed.\nProvides new insight into population balance models incorporating random particle growth, dynamic morphological structure, and complex multivariate formulations with a clear exposition of their mathematical derivation.\nPresents a wide range of solution techniques, Monte Carlo simulation methods with a lucid exposition of their origin and scope for enhancing computational efficiency.\nAn account of self-similar solutions of population balance equations and their significance to the treatment of data on particulate systems.\nThe only available treatment of the solution of inverse problems essential for identification of population balance models for breakage and aggregation processes, particle nucleation and growth processes and so on.\nA comprehensive treatment of the stochastic formulation of small systems with several new applications.\nBENEFITS\n(The benefits correspond to the features above in the same order)\nThis helps to find new applications of population balances and expanding the scope of their applications.\nProvides directions for sophistication of population balance models to accommodate various complications not envisaged before.\nUseful for process engineers interested in the simulation and control of particulate systems.\nOf significance to the treatment of experimental data on dispersed phase systems.\nUseful for process engineers interested in the simulation and control of particulate systems.\nDevelops the modeling of stochastic systems with promising new areas of applications (e.g., design of sterilization systems, radiation treatment of cancerous tumors).", "categories": "Chemistry - Physical Chemistry", "year": "2000", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Academic Press", "language": "english", "pages": "365", "ISBN10": "0125769709", "ISBN13": "9780125769709", "file": "PDF, 6.30 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/533027", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/533027/79d486"},

At the same time, advances in computing and networking technologies for heteregeneous and grid environments afford new possibilities for theoretical studies of chemical reactivity. As a consequence, calculation of atom+diatom reactions has become routine, accurate methods have been developed to describe reactions in tetra-atomic systems, nonadiabatic reactions are being studied in simultaneous experimental and theoretical efforts, and statistical theories of unimolecular reaction dynamics are applied to systems that were a mystery a few years ago.

The presentation of the theoretical subjects is supported by approximately 500 exercises with solutions as well as commented examples of calculations; throughout the book the relation to civil engineering practice is demonstrated.

Although these materials seem very different, they have common structural and dynamic properties that are somewhere between those of crystalline solids and simple molecular liquids and gases. Soft matter is an interdisciplinary subject drawing not only from physics, chemistry and materials science but also from biology, biochemistry and engineering. These materials have a wide range of applications, such as in structural and packaging materials, foams and adhesives, detergents and cosmetics, paints, food additives and biological materials. Written in an \"easy-to-follow style\", this textbook provides an introduction to this exciting subject with chapters covering natural and synthetic polymers, colloids, surfactants, biological soft matter and liquid crystals and the many and varied applications of these materials. It has been newly edited and has chapters with updated coverage of recent aspects of polymer science. A series of questions and answers is also provided at the end of each chapter. The book contains a new chapter on biological soft matter, which adds significantly to the discussion of proteins, DNA and lipid membranes in the previous edition. The book will appeal to students of polymer, biomaterial, colloid, surface and interface science.

All too often it appears that such students tend to regard the subject as an academic and burdensome discipline, only to discover at a later date that it is a highly important tool of great prac tical value. The writers purpose has been to explain the general structure of thermodynamics, and to give some indication of how it may be used to yield results having a direct bearing on the work of the chemist. More than one hundred illustrative numerical problems are worked out in the text, and a total of about three hundred and sixty exercises of a variety of types have been included for solution by the reader. In the hope of imparting the whole subject with an aspect of reality, much of the material for this purpose has been taken from the chemical literature, to which references are given. In order to economize space, and at the same time to test the readers grasp of thermodynamics, the derivations of a number of interesting results have been set as exercises. To this extent, at least, the exercises are to be considered as part of the text, although their solution should in any event be regarded as essential to any adequate course in chemical thermodynamics. In treating the various topics in this book the particular method em ployed has been determined in each case by considerations of simplicity, usefulness and logical development. In some instances the classical, his torical approach has been preferred, but in others the discussion follows more modern lines. Whenever feasible the generalized procedures, involv ing reduced temperatures and pressures, which have been evolved in recent years chiefly by chemical engineers, are introduced. As regards statistical methods, the author feels that the time has come for them to take their place as an essential part of chemical thermodynamics. Consequently, the applications of partition functions to the determination of heat capaci ties, entropies, free energies, equilibrium constants, etc., have been intro duced into the text in the appropriate places where it is hoped their value will be appreciated. The symbols and nomenclature are essentially those which have been widely adopted in the American chemical literature however, for reasons given in the text, and in accordance with a modern trend, the Gibbs symbol M and the shorter term chemical potential are employed for the partial molar free energy. Because atmospheric pressure is postulated for the conventional standard state of a liquid, some confusion has resulted from the use of the same symbol for the standard state as for the liquid at an arbitrary pressure. Hence, the former state is indicated in the text in VI PREFAOB the usual manner, by a zero or circle, but the latter is distinguished by a small square as superscript. The writer would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge his in debtedness to certain books, namely, F. H. Macdougall, Thermodynamics and Chemistry L. E. Steiner, Introduction to Chemical Thermody namics B. F. Dodge, Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics and, in particular, G. N. Lewis and M. Randall, Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances. He is also sincerely grateful to Dr. Allen E. Steam, University of Missouri, and Dr. Roy F. Newton, Purdue I diversity, for reading the manuscript of this book and for making numerous suggestions which have helped materially to clarify and improve the treat ment. Finally, the author wishes to express his thanks to his wife for reading the proofs, and for her continued aid and encouragement. SAMUEL GLASSTONE BERKELEY, CALJF.

So many modifications in classic version of BZ reaction have been carried out in various experimental conditions that demonstrate rich varieties of temporal oscillations and spatio-temporal patterns in non- equilibrium conditions. Mixed-mode versions of BZ reactions, which comprise a pair of organic substrates or dual metal catalysts, have displayed very complex oscillating behaviours and novel space-time patterns during reaction processes. These characteristic spatio-temporal properties of BZ reactions have attracted increasing attention of the scientific community in recent years because of its comparable periodic structures in electrochemical systems, polymerization processes, and non-equilibrium crystallization phenomena. Instead, non-equilibrium crystallization phenomena which lead to development of novel crystal morphologies in constraint of thermodynamic equilibrium conditions have been investigated and are said to be stationary periodic structures. Efforts have continued to analyze insight mechanisms and roles of reaction-diffusion mechanism and self-organization in the growth of such periodic crystal patterns. In this book, non-equilibrium crystallization phenomena, leading to growth of some novel crystal patterns in dual organic substrate modes of oscillatory BZ reactions have been discussed. Efforts have been made to find out experimental parameters where transitions of the spherulitic crystal patterns take place. The book provides the scientific community and entrepreneurs with a thorough understanding and knowledge of the growth and form of branched crystal pattern in reaction-diffusion system and their morphological transition.", "categories": "Chemistry - Physical Chemistry", "year": "2016", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer Singapore", "language": "english", "pages": "79", "ISBN13": "9789811008641", "file": "PDF, 2.51 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

In nature one can find an array of impressive and elegant examples of superhydrophobic surfaces. For example, on a lotus leaf rain drops bounce off after impact, then entirely roll off the lotus leaf and drag along any dirt particles, without leaving residues. The artificial design of superhydrophobic and self-cleaning surfaces has become an extremely active area of fundamental and applied research. This book presents both fundamental and applied aspects of superhydrophobic surfaces. It describes also different strategies for making superhydrophobic surfaces from a large diversity of materials (polymers, metals and other inorganic materials, composites) and processes (lithographic techniques, electrochemical processes, self-assembly processes, colloidal particles, sol-gel processes, nanofilaments, or simple scraping). A bountiful of information is covered in this book which represents cumulative wisdom of many world-renowned researchers in the fascinating and burgeoning area of superhydrophobic surfaces", "categories": "Chemistry - Physical Chemistry", "year": "2009", "edition": "1", "publisher": "CRC Press", "language": "english", "pages": "496 / 510", "ISBN13": "9789004165939", "file": "PDF, 14.64 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2374203", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2374203/f91c54"},

The role of the basic effect in technology was probably first demonstrated by chemical engineers in the field of liquid-liquid extraction. Indeed, phenomena attributable to Marangoni flows have been reported in innumerable instances relevant to modern technologies, such as in hot salt corrosion in aeroturbine blades; the drying of solvent-containing paints; the drying of silicon wafers used in electronics; in materials processing, particularly in metallic systems which have been suspected to demonstrate Marangoni flows.", "categories": "Chemistry - Physical Chemistry", "year": "2002", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer-Verlag Wien", "language": "english", "pages": "283 / 287", "ISBN13": "9783709125502", "file": "PDF, 26.54 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

However, most texts that are currently available to students still treat thermodynamics very much as it was presented in the 19th century, generally for historical rather than pedagogical reasons. Modern Thermodynamics takes a different approach, and deals with the relationship between irreversible processes and entropy.The relationship between irreversible processes and entropy is introduced early on, enabling the reader to benefit from seeing the relationship in such processes as heat conduction and chemical reactions. This text presents thermodynamics in a contemporary and exciting manner, with a wide range of applications, and many exercises and examples. Students are also encouraged to use computers through the provision of Mathematica code and Internet / WWW addresses where real data and additional information can be found.

The handedness, or chirality, of molecules in liquid crystals has a remarkable influence on the macroscopic physical properties of these systems, including the appearance of new phases. Indeed, the majority of optical applications of liquid crystals is due to chiral structures, namely the thermochromic effect of cholesteric liquid crystals, the optical activity in twisted nematic liquid crystal displays, and the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric switching of smectic liquid crystals.    This book describes the main aspects of chirality in liquid crystals, and points out some of the open questions of current research. The chapters, each by an expert in the field, reviews the highlights of the important topics and representative questions in the field of chiral liquid crystals.

Since then this field has seen remarkable technical developments as well as a broadening of the applications of sol-gel science and technology. There is a growing need for a comprehensive reference that treats both the fundamentals and the applications, and this is the aim of Handbook of Sol-Gel Science and Technology.  The primary purpose of sol-gel science and technology is to produce materials, active and non-active including optical, electronic, chemical, sensor, bio- and structural materials. This means that sol-gel science and technology is related to all kinds of manufacturing industries. Thus Volume 1, Sol-Gel Processing, is devoted to general aspects of processing. Newly developed materials such as organic-inorganic hybrids, photonic crystals, ferroelectric coatings, photocatalysts will be covered. Topics in this volume include: Synthesis and reaction of sol-gel precursors, Preparation of bulk glass and ceramics, Processing of porous materials based on self-organization, Synthesis of organic-inorganic hybrid materials, Coating of plastics, Special processes used in sol-gel formation of materials (1. Non-hydrolytic sol-gel process, 2. Sonogels, and 3. UV irradiation). Volume 2, Characterization of Sol-Gel Materials and Products, highlights the important fact that useful materials are only produced when characterization is tied to processing. Furthermore, characterization is essential to the understanding of nanostructured materials, and sol-gel technology is a most important technology in this new field. Since nanomaterials display their functional property based on their nano- and micro-structure, \"characterization\" is very important. Topics found in Volume 2 include: Determination of structure by NMR, In-situ characterization of the sol-gel reaction process, Determination of microstructure of oxide gels, Characterization of porous structure of gels by the surface measurements, Characterization of organic-inorganic hybrid, Measurements of rheological properties, Measurements of functional properties: fluorescence, laser, non-linear optical and other properties. Sol-gel technology is a versatile technology, making it possible to produce a wide variety of materials and to provide existing substances with novel properties. This technology was applied to producing novel materials, for example organic-inorganic hybrids, which are quite difficult to make by other fabricating techniques, and it was also applied to producing materials based on high temperature superconducting oxides. Volume 3, Applications of Sol-Gel Technology, will cover applications such as: Application of sol-gel method to processing of bulk silica glasses, Bulk porous gels prepared by sol-gel method, Application of sol-gel method to fabrication of glass and ceramic fibers, Reflective and antireflective coating films, Planar waveguides prepared by sol-gel method, Films with micropatterns and two-dimensional photonic crystals, Application of sol-gel method to formation of ferroelectric films, Application of sol-gel method to formation of photocatalytic coating films, Application of sol-gel method to bioactive coating films.", "categories": "Chemistry - Physical Chemistry", "year": "2004", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Kluwer Academic", "language": "english", "pages": "2040 / 1986", "ISBN10": "1402079699", "ISBN13": "9781402079696", "file": "PDF, 99.79 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

This textbook, aimed at undergraduate or graduate level students (depending on the college or university), concentrates on how to make predictions about the numbers of each kind of basic state of a quantum system from only two ingredients: the symmetry and the linear model of quantum mechanics. This method, involving the mathematical area of representation theory or group theory, combines three core mathematical subjects, namely, linear algebra, analysis and abstract algebra. Wide applications of this method occur in crystallography, atomic structure, classification of manifolds with symmetry, and other areas. The topics unfold systematically, introducing the reader first to an important example of a quantum system with symmetry, the single electron in a hydrogen atom. Then the reader is given just enough mathematical tools to make predictions about the numbers of each kind of electronic orbital based solely on the physical spherical symmetry of the hydrogen atom. The final chapters address the related ideas of quantum spin, measurement and entanglement. This user-friendly exposition, driven by numerous examples and exercises, requires a solid background in calculus and familiarity with either linear algebra or advanced quantum mechanics.\u00a0Linearity, Symmetry, and Prediction in the\u00a0Hydrogen Atom\u00a0will benefit students in mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as a literate general readership.

The book is addressed mainly to gradu\u00ad ate students and research scientists interested in designing experiments the results of which may be interpreted at the molecular level, or in interpreting such experimental results. It is not addressed to those who intend to practice statistical thermodynamics per se. With this goal in mind, I have expended a great deal of effort to make the book clear, readable, and, I hope, enjoyable. This does not necessarily mean that the book as a whole is easy to read. The first four chapters are very detailed. The last four become progressively more difficult to read, for several reasons. First, presuming that the reader has already acquired familiarity with the methods and arguments presented in the first part, I felt that similar arguments could be skipped later on, leaving the details to be filled in by the reader.

The approach is logically based on the fact that thermodynamic work is mediated by thermal energy through the tendency for nonthermal energy to convert spontaneously into thermal energy and for thermal energy to distribute spontaneously and uniformly within the accessible space. The fact that free energy is a Second-Law, expendable energy that makes it possible for thermodynamic work to be done at finite rates is emphasized. Entropy, as originally defined, is pointed out to be the capacity factor for thermal energy that is hidden with respect to temperature; it serves to evaluate the practical quality of thermal energy and to account for changes in the amounts of latent thermal energies in systems maintained at constant temperature. With entropy thus operationally defined, it is possible to see that T\u2206S\u00b0 of the Gibbs standard free energy relation \u2206G\u00b0 = \u2206H\u00b0 \u2212 T\u2206S\u00b0 serves to account for differences or changes in nonthermal energies that do not contribute to \u2206G\u00b0 and that, since \u2206H\u00b0 serves to account for differences or changes in total energy, complete enthalpy-entropy (\u2206H\u00b0 \u2013 T\u2206S\u00b0) compensation must invariably occur in isothermal processes for which T\u2206S\u00b0 is finite. A major objective was to clarify the means by which free energy is transferred and conserved in sequences of biological reactions coupled by freely diffusible intermediates. In achieving this objective it was found necessary to distinguish between a 'characteristic free energy' possessed by all First-Law energies in amounts equivalent to the amounts of the energies themselves and a 'ree energy of concentration' that is intrinsically mechanical and relatively elusive in that it can appear to be free of First-Law energy. The findings in this regard serve to clarify the fact that the transfer of chemical potential energy from one repository to another along sequences of biological reactions of the above sort occurs through transfer of the First-Law energy as thermal energy and transfer of the Second-Law energy as free energy of concentration.", "categories": "Chemistry - Physical Chemistry", "language": "english", "pages": "18", "file": "PDF, 337 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3239054", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3239054/5d1827"},

Firstly, there is a lack of modern comprehensive publications on the chemistry of ion exchange materials and on the relationships between their properties and practical applications. Secondly, there are few books on ion exchange chemistry that are targeted to industrial R&D specialists and research students who (i) do not work with ion exchange on a daily basis, (ii) need to develop competence in this area, and (iii) find it difficult to start studying the subject from primary scientific publications. The book bridges these gaps by describing classical and modern theoretical concepts, as well as practical approaches for using ion exchange materials. Ion exchange materials combine properties of homogeneous and heterogeneous materials. Besides being an interesting subject for investigation, they are essential in a wide variety of industrial technologies: in the chemical and biochemical industries, pharmacy, medicine, microelectronics, the nuclear industry, food production, waste treatment, and many other areas. Ion exchange is a powerful tool in chemical analysis and scientific research.

Green Energy and Technology serves as a publishing platform for scientific and technological approaches to \"green\" - i.e., environmentally friendly and sustainable - technologies. While the main focus lies on energy and power supply, the series also covers green solutions in industrial engineering and engineering design. Green Energy and Technology is a monograph series addressing researchers, advanced students and technical consultants, as well as decision makers in industry and politics. The level presentation ranges from instructional to highly technical.The modern world is facing three critical problems: high fuel prices, climate change, and air pollution. Biohydrogen: For Future Engine Fuel Demands covers the production, purification, storage, pipeline transport, usage, and safety of biohydrogen. Hydrogen promises to be the most significant fuel source of the future, due to its global availability and the fact that water is its only by-product. Biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, bio-oil, and biohydrogen are produced using technologies for thermochemically and biologically converting biomass. Hydrogen fuel production technologies can make use of either non-renewable sources, or renewable sources such as wind, solar, and biorenewable resources.Biohydrogen: For Future Engine Fuel Demands reviews all of the modern biomass-based transportation fuels, including bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, biohydrogen, and fuel cells. The book also discusses issues of biohydrogen economy, policy and environmental impact.

Readers of this book benefit from the systematic development of the theory; this starts with general principles, going through the applications to single component fluid systems, and finishing with the theory of mixtures, including chemical reactions. The authors describe the simplest mixture model \u2013 the linear fluid \u2013 and highlight many practical and thermodynamically consistent equations for describing transport properties and reaction kinetics for this model. Further on in the book, the authors also describe more complex models. Samoh\u00fdl and Peka\u0159 take special care to clearly explain all methodology and starting axioms and they also describe in detail applied assumptions and simplifications.

Hydrogen has shocked, it has surprised, it has embarrassed, it has humbled--and again and again it has guided physicists to the edge of new vistas where the promise of basic understanding and momentous insights beckoned. The allure of hydrogen, crucial to life and critical to scientific discovery, is at the center of this book, which tells a story that begins with the big bang and continues to unfold today.    In this biography of hydrogen, John Rigden shows how this singular atom, the most abundant in the universe, has helped unify our understanding of the material world from the smallest scale, the elementary particles, to the largest, the universe itself. It is a tale of startling discoveries and dazzling practical benefits spanning more than one hundred years--from the first attempt to identify the basic building block of atoms in the mid-nineteenth century to the discovery of the Bose-Einstein condensate only a few years ago. With Rigden as an expert and engaging guide, we see how hydrogen captured the imagination of many great scientists--such as Heisenberg, Pauli, Schr?dinger, Dirac, and Rabi--and how their theories and experiments with this simple atom led to such complex technical innovations as magnetic resonance imaging, the maser clock, and global positioning systems. Along the way, we witness the transformation of science from an endeavor of inspired individuals to a monumental enterprise often requiring the cooperation of hundreds of scientists around the world.    Still, any biography of hydrogen has to end with a question: What new surprises await us?

Undesired contaminants are removed by adsorption onto activated carbon. While activated carbon has been used extensively in industrial applications, little research has been performed to evaluate using activated carbon to remove low concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from indoor air environments. In this research, activated carbon cloth (ACC) is examined for its equilibrium adsorption capacity for several VOCs of relevance to indoor air quality. If the technology proves viable, filters made from ACC could be placed in new or existing air circulation systems of buildings and residences to effectively remove VOCs from indoor air.Adsorption isotherms were measured for acetaldehyde. acetone, benzene, methyl-ethyl ketone, and water vapor and three ACC types. For the 10 to 1000 ppmv concentration range examined, benzene exhibited the highest adsorption capacity on ACC. followed by MEK. acetone, and acetaldehyde. Water vapor adsorption was not significant on ACC until relative humidities above about 50% (P/P0 0.5), when capillary condensation of H2O(g) occurred within ACC pores.Equilibrium adsorption experiments were not performed for VOCs in the sub-ppmv concentration range, due to the long times (estimated at weeks to months) to reach equilibrium and the high cost of compressed gases. The Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich equations were used to model the adsorption capacities into the sub-ppmv range for the four adsorbates and three ACC types examined in this research. The sub-ppmv concentration range is a more realistic concentration range for VOCs present in indoor air environments\u2026", "categories": "Chemistry - Physical Chemistry", "language": "english", "pages": "99", "file": "PDF, 620 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3003041", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3003041/23ad1d"},

Wolfson", "Yochanan Silman"], "rating": "0", "description": "The main purpose of this book is to present a rigorous and logical discussion of the fundamentals of thermodynamics and to develop in a coherent fashion the application of the basic principles to a number of systems of interest to chemists. The concept of temperature is carefully discussed, and special emphasis is placed on the appropriate method for the introduction of molecular weights into thermodynamics. A new treatment of the second law of thermodynamics is presented which demonstrates that Caratheodory\u2019s principle is a necessary and sufficient consequence of the physical statements of Clausius and Kelvin.\r\nThe analysis of the application of thermodynamics to various systems is carried out in terms of measurable quantities wherever possible. Operational treatments of gas mixtures and electrochemical systems are discussed. In particular, we note that the concept of single\u00ad electrode potential can be made operational.\r\nA detailed and general study of heterogeneous equilibrium is made. Surface phenomena are discussed from the point of view of Gibbs which seems to us to provide the best connection with molecular theory. The treatment of dielectrics utilizes a form of the first law which is more general than those usually used. \r\nThis book is based on lectures by Professor Kirkwood in a graduate course in thermodynamics at the California Institute of Technology. Most of the presentations were developed by Professor Kirkwood during the course of 20 years of teaching and active research in the field and reflect his ability to provide a logical and thorough treatment of the subject. The lecture notes were written up by one of the authors (I. Oppenheim) and by Prof. M. Karplus and A. Rich. The notes have attained a large circulation in mimeographed form and have been used in a large number of universities.\r\nThis book is meant to be a textbook and is primarily intended to serve as the basis of a senior or graduate course in thermodynamics.

While metabolism provides the power and building blocks for plant life, it is the hormones that regulate the speed of growth of the individual parts and integrate them to produce the form that we recognize as a plant.This book is a description of these natural chemicals: how they are synthesized and metabolized, how they act at both the organismal and molecular levels, how we measure them, a description of some of the roles they play in regulating plant growth and development, and the prospects for the genetic engineering of hormone levels or responses in crop plants.

Because these and others are diseases deeply connected with the state of our emotional bodies. Too often, the Western medical approach fails to address the emotional dimension of illness. This is where traditional plant medicines, with their ability to alter consciousness and open channels of communication to our emotions, offer so much promise.The stories shared here demonstrate the astonishing-mystical, colorful, metaphysical-effects of ayahuasca and Traditional Amazonian Plant Medicine.

Rich in its breath and depth, this introduction to modern theories and methods of study is suitable for experienced researchers those new to the subject.      Edited by two leading experts, and bringing together the foremost practitioners in the field, this up-to-date account of a rapidly developing field sits at the interface between biology, chemistry and physics. It covers computational, kinetic and structural analysis of tunnelling and the synergy in combining these methods (with a major focus on H-tunneling reactions in enzyme systems).     The book starts with a brief overview of proton and electron transfer history by Nobel Laureate, Rudolph A. Marcus. The reader is then guided through chapters covering almost every aspect of reactions in enzyme catalysis ranging from descriptions of the relevant quantum theory and quantum/classical theoretical methodology to the description of experimental results. The theoretical interpretation of these large systems includes both quantum mechanical and statistical mechanical computations, as well as simple more approximate models.     Most of the chapters focus on enzymatic catalysis of hydride, proton and H\" transfer, an example of the latter being proton coupled electron transfer. There is also a chapter on electron transfer in proteins. This is timely since the theoretical framework developed fifty years ago for treating electron transfers has now been adapted to H-transfers and electron transfers in proteins.

Water confers to lipid membranes unique features in terms of surface and mechanical properties. The analysis of the hydration forces, plasticiser effects, controlled hydration, formation of microdomains of confined water suggests that water is an active constituent in a water-lipid system.The chapters describe water organization at the lipid membrane\u2013water interphase, the water penetration, the long range water structure in the presence of lipid membranes by means of X-ray and neutron scattering, general polarization, fluorescent probes, ATR-FTIR and near infrared spectroscopies, piezo electric methods, computer simulation and surface thermodynamics.Permeation, percolation, osmotic stress, polarization, protrusion, sorption, hydrophobicity, density fluctuations are treated in detail in self-assembled bilayers. Studies in lipid monolayers show the correlation of surface pressure with water activity and its role in peptide and enzyme interactions. The book concludes with a discussion on anhydrobiosis and the effect of water replacement in microdomains and its consequence for cell function. New definitions of lipid/water interphases consider water not only as a structural-making solvent but as a mediator in signalling metabolic activity, modulating protein insertion and enzymatic activity, triggering oscillatory reactions and functioning of membrane bound receptors. Since these effects occur at the molecular level, membrane hydration appears fundamental to understand the behavior of nano systems and confined environments mimicking biological systems.These insights in structural, thermodynamical and mechanical water properties give a base for new paradigms in membrane structure and function for those interested in biophysics, physical chemistry, biology, bio and nano medicine, biochemistry, biotechnology and nano sciences searching for biotechnological inputs in human health, food industry, plant growing and energy conversion.", "categories": "Chemistry - Biochemistry", "year": "2015", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer International Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "295", "ISBN13": "9783319190600", "file": "PDF, 7.15 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

In the first section, the principles of bacterial growth are given, as well as the description of the different layers that enclose the bacterial cytoplasm, and their role in obtaining nutrients from the outside media through different permeability mechanism described in detail. A chapter is devoted to allostery and is indispensable for the comprehension of many regulatory mechanisms described throughout the book. Another section analyses the mechanisms by which cells obtain the energy necessary for their growth, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic and the anaplerotic cycles. Two chapters are devoted to classes of microorganisms rarely dealt with in textbooks, namely the Archaea, mainly the methanogenic bacteria, and the methylotrophs. Eight chapters describe the principles of the regulations at the transcriptional level, with the necessary knowledge of the machineries of transcription and translation. The next fifteen chapters deal with the biosynthesis of the cell building blocks, amino acids, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and deoxynucleotides, water-soluble vitamins and coenzymes, isoprene and tetrapyrrole derivatives and vitamin B12. The two last chapters are devoted to the study of protein-DNA interactions and to the evolution of biosynthetic pathways. The considerable advances made in the last thirty years in the field by the introduction of gene cloning and sequencing and by the exponential development of physical methods such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance have helped presenting metabolism under a multidisciplinary attractive angle.

This long-awaited second edition contains new and simplified protocols useful for industrial applications, novel techniques that will prove useful now or in the near future, and protocols for the preparation of immobilized derivatives suitable for a wide variety of nonconventional reaction media. The authors also offer tools for the development of new immobilization techniques, methods for preparing immobilized derivatives for therapeutic and industrial use, and new chemical reactors designed to overcome the limitations of immobilized derivatives. The emphasis is on improving enzyme and cell properties via very simple immobilization protocols, along with the development of new and better methods. The protocols follow the successful Methods in Biotechnology\u2122 series format, each offering step-by-step laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principles behind the technique, lists of the necessary equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls.  Innovative and highly practical, Immobilization of Enzymes and Cells, Second Edition, affords biochemists, biotechnologists, and biochemical engineers a practical review of all the latest methods and tools-as well as optimized conventional techniques-needed to carry out successful research involving immobilizing enzymes and cells.", "categories": "Chemistry - Biochemistry", "year": "2006", "edition": "2", "publisher": "Humana Press", "language": "english", "pages": "450 / 465", "ISBN10": "1597450537", "ISBN13": "9781588292902", "file": "PDF, 6.40 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/678146", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/678146/c06943"},

Seed development is a key step of the plant life cycle that determines the nutrient value of seeds \u2013 the life for human civilization, growth, and development. The nutrient value of seeds is mainly due to storage reserve products such as carbohydrates, lipids (triacylglycerols), and proteins. The book primarily focuses on application of the 21st century high-throughput technologies transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and systems biology in near complete understanding of the various processes involved in seed development in different crop plants. The book reveals how such technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the multilayer processes and regulations involved therein by generating large-scale datasets.

First, the reader will enjoy broad yet detailed coverage of modern theoretical approaches to the structures, electronic properties, and dynamical behaviour of peptides, metalloenzymes, bioinorganic systems, proteins, and nucleic acids. Also included are excellent methods-oriented chapters focused on Qm/MM methods, Car-Parinello molecular dynamics, and classical dynamics of biomolecules near transition states. Second, the writing and editing are of uniformly high quality. Each chapter is a valuable and timely point of entry to the literature of the subfield of computational chemistry that is being covered. Some chapters focus on the authors\u2019 own contributions, whereas others are broader and more inclusive in scope, but all are extremely well-written and the authors do a great job of placing their own work in a larger context \u2013 something often not achieved in review series. \u2026 Overall, this volume constitutes an outstanding contribution to the Topics in Current Chemistry series.

It is a shorter, lighter book with a new, integrated table of contents that develops general, organic, and biochemistry topics together, rather than in isolation.In introducing GOB material, this text uses an integrated approach in which related general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry topics are presented in adjacent chapters. This approach helps students see the strong connections that exist between these three branches of chemistry, and allows instructors to discuss these, interrelationships while the material is still fresh in students' minds. This integration involves the following sets of chapters:* Chapter 3 (Compounds) and Chapter 4 (An Introduction to Organic Compounds). An introduction to bonding and compounds is followed by a look at the members of a few key organic families.* Chapters 3, 4 and 6.(Reactions).. A study of inorganic.and organic compounds is followed (after a look at gases, liquids, and solids in Chapter 5) by an introduction to their reactions.* Chapter 7 (Solutions) and Chapter 8 (Lipids and Membranes) A discussion.of solubility is followed by a look at the importance of solubility in biochemistry.

It will serve as a reliable map through the maze of cell signalling pathways and help the reader understand how malfunctions in these pathways can lead to disease. The book is divided into four parts. Part 1 describes the machinery of signal transduction starting with the properties of signals, receptors (including receptor activation), regulators, and the molecules that link receptor and regulator. The design of signalling cascades is explained by describing central signalling pathways: the Ras-regulated MAPK and PI-3 pathways; the Rho/Rac/Cdc 42 pathway controlling chemotaxis and regulating the cytoskeleton; the G protein coupled receptor cascades in response to sensory and hormonal signals; signalling by TGF-ss in morphogenesis; cytokine signalling that controls haemopoiesis. There is also a discussion of the insulin response. As phosphorylation - dephosphorylation is involved in nearly all cellular regulatory processes, Part 1 concludes with a synopsis of its role in signalling. Part 2 describes the implementation of the signalling cascades focusing on the effect on gene transcription. After a brief description of the transcriptional machinery the regulation of transcription by cytokines and growth factors in the control of cell growth and the mechanisms and sites of control are discussed in detail. The regulators discussed include Jun/Fos, NF-AT, SREBPs, and STATs. The next two chapters cover gene regulation by nuclear receptors, including both the steroid hormone receptors and non-steroid nuclear receptors e.g. the retinoic acid receptors RAR and RXR. Part 3 studies the global cellular regulatory programs for the control of cell growth and proliferation. The first chapter concerns the regulation of the cell cycle and the role of the cyclin-dependent kinases, telomerase, Ran, and cell cycle checkpoints. The next topic is the signalling pathways in apoptosis: the TNF-receptor family death receptors, caspases, and the intracellular apoptosis signals and the role of apoptosis in the lifecycle of cells. Part 3 ends with a discussion of the signal pathways involved in the immune response, focusing on the involvement of cell-cell interactions. Part 4 considers loss of regulatory control and its consequences with respect to the molecular basis of cancer. It first describes the cellular regulatory proteins that have oncogenic potential, how they can become oncogenic and cause the transformation of normal cells to cancerous cells. Next is an analysis of the loss of developmental controls, the APC protein, ss-catenin, and the Wnt pathway, that lead to mature terminally differentiated cells reverting to immature embryonic cells. The book ends with a summary of the molecular and cellular causes of cancer and an outlook for novel therapies. Throughout the text, the emphasis is on structure and mechanism and is well illustrated with 200 figures.

The majority of pre-clinical medical students do not need a detailed biochemistry text book, but rather \"biochemistry as a basis\" or as an \"add-on\". The major challenge for them is to integrate biochemical knowledge, to clinical application in the understanding of the etiology of diseases, their diagnosis and treatment.Essential Biochemistry for Medicine is not intended to be an exhaustive, comprehensive reference; rather a concise, accessible guide that will help first year students, from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, gain a good basic understanding of the biochemistry behind common medical disorders. It integrates biochemistry with clinical applications and the understanding of the etiology of diseases, their diagnosis and treatment. Each chapter includes a concise and simple introduction to the relevant biochemistry and terminology to reinforce what biomedical students have covered, orientate them and encourage them to consider the medical context; whilst at the same time outlining the biochemistry in a simple, \"must know\" format, for medical students before directing them to the all important clinical considerations.Key Features:A fully integrated approach to give students a basic understanding of the biochemistry behind common medical disordersConcise, accessible and well-written with numerous clear illustrations in full colour throughoutUses 'FOCUS' sections to expand on certain areas such as diabetes, HIV and obesityIncludes links and quick references for those wanting a broader knowledge of each topic", "categories": "Chemistry - Biochemistry", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Wiley", "language": "english", "pages": "327", "ISBN10": "0470743271", "ISBN13": "9780470743270", "file": "PDF, 1.57 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1021560", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1021560/95e6f4"},

Chapters cover oxidation potential, mechanisms of oxidation of the main food components (proteins and lipids), addition of exogenous oxidants during food processing, and the effects of physical agents such as irradiation, freeze-thawing, and high hydrostatic pressure during processing. The book also discusses the effects of oxidation on sensory characteristics of food components and analyzes how oxidation and antioxidants affect the nutritive and health-promoting features of food components.The text examines natural antioxidants in food, including lesser-known ones such as amino acids and polysaccharides, antioxidants generated in food as a result of processing, mechanisms of antioxidant activity, and measurement of antioxidant activity of food components. It explores the bioavailability of curcuminoid and carotenoids antioxidants and presents case studies on natural food antioxidants, presenting novel extraction methods for preservation of antioxidant activity. The final chapters address functional antioxidant foods and beverages as well as general ideas on the effects of food on the redox homeostasis of the organism.", "categories": "Chemistry - Biochemistry", "year": "2013", "publisher": "CRC Press", "language": "english", "pages": "570", "ISBN10": "143988241X", "ISBN13": "9781439882412", "file": "PDF, 8.38 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2085703", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2085703/998971"},

The authors distill information on biological processes needed to understand vanadium effects in biological systems and make this information accessible to a wide range of readers, including chemists without extensive biological training. Building a hierarchy of complexity, the book provides a discussion of some basic principles of 51V NMR spectroscopy followed by a description of the self-condensation reactions of vanadate itself. The authors delineate reactions with simple monodentate ligands and then proceed to more complicated systems such as diols, a-hydroxy acids, amino acids, peptides, to name just a few. They revisit aspects of this sequence later, but first highlight the influence the electronic properties of ligands have on coordination and reactivity. They then compare and contrast the influences of ligands, particularly those of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxylamine, on heteroligand reactivity.  The book includes coverage of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases and model systems, vanadium in the environment, and technological applications. It also briefly covers the catalytic reactions of peroxovanadate and haloperoxidase model compounds. It contains a discussion of the vanadium haloperoxidases and the biological and biochemical activities of vanadium(V) including potential pharmacological applications. The last chapters step outside these boundaries by introducing some aspects of the future of vanadium in nanotechnology, the recyclable redox battery, and the lithium/silver vanadium oxide battery. Primary sources documented after each chapter minimize the need to search the literature, 80 illustrations provide structural information, reaction schemes, spectra, speciation diagrams, and biochemical schemes, and 22 tables present detailed information with references to primary sources.

As the predominant constituent in bone, cartilage, skin, tendon, and tooth, it is not surprising that collagen is of interest to anatomists, biochemists, biomedical engineers, cell biologists, dermatolo\u00ad gists, dental surgeons, leather chemists, orthopedic surgeons, physiologists, physicians, zoologists, and a host of others. This book was planned to provide an up-to-date comprehensive survey of all aspects of biochemistry of collagen. The recent discovery of genetically distinct collagens with tissue specificity has opened a new era in collagen biochemistry, and Karl Piez discusses this in the opening chapter on primary structure. In the next chapter, Ramachandran and Rama\u00ad krishnan deal with the molecular structure of collagen, placing special emphasis on the conformational aspects of its polypeptide chains. Follow\u00ad ing the consideration of primary and secondary structure of collagen, the three-dimensional arrangement of collagen molecules in the fibrils is covered by Miller in Chapter 3. Collagen is generally in the insoluble state in the living organism due to the cross-linking of individual molecules, and Tanzer describes the various aspects of this cross-linkage in Chapter 4. The biosynthesis of collagen is discussed in depth by Prockop and his colleagues.", "categories": "Chemistry - Biochemistry", "year": "1976", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer US", "language": "english", "pages": "536 / 545", "ISBN13": "9781475746020", "file": "PDF, 12.31 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

Nowadays, one has to be an insider to even understand the titles of journals, as modern biochemists have a tendency to invent new terms to describe old phenomena and apply acronyms in a haphazard way. In addition, while the use of kits now saves time, by taking shortcuts, many have lost touch with the principles that lie behind the processes they employ.     Assembled by Roger Lundblad, the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Compendium provides both academic and industrial researchers with an exceptionally accessible resource that offers a plethora of practical information not found in more database-oriented resources. A renowned scientist and author who bridges the old school of protein research and current proteomics, Dr. Lundblad is uniquely qualified to bring forth this handy resource.    With great respect for the roots of the science, Dr. Lundblad provides a list of commonly used acronyms with definitions, as well as a glossary of terms and subjects used in biochemistry, molecular biology, biotechnology, proteomics, genomics, and systems biology. He also provides a chapter on those chemicals commonly employed in biochemistry and molecular biology, complete with properties and structure drawings, as well as a detailed accounting of protease inhibitors and protease inhibitor cocktails.\u00a0 A list of organic name reactions used in biochemistry is also included, as is a list of buffers with references to specific uses and unwanted side reactions.   \u00a0  Until now, this information could only be garnered from older books and Internet searches convoluted by uncertain nomenclature.

Since space is at a premium, we have denied ourselves the luxury of a philosophical discussion of the problems of defining organelles. Rather we have chosen to include all those intracellular structures which have limiting membranes and definable compartments. The separate chapters consider nuclei, plastids, mitochondria, microbodies, endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum; Golgi bodies, lysosomes and various secretory vesicles, including chromaffin granules and synaptic vesicles. Nucleoli, ribosomes, and centrioles are included in the chapter on nuclei. New and exciting informatioIi about all these structures has emerged in recent years-for example; the nUcleosome, interrupted genes, signal sequences on proteins destined. for the bioenergetic organelles, mapping and sequencing of organelle genes, and consolidation of chemiosmosis as a unifying principle in energy transduction.

Kohler", "Christopher Flint", "Andrea Natale", "Antonio Raviele"], "rating": "0", "description": "This penetrating case study of institution building and entrepreneurship in science shows how a minor medical speciality evolved into a large and powerful academic discipline. Drawing extensively on little-used archival sources, the author analyses in detail how biomedical science became a central part of medical training and practice. The book shows how biochemistry was defined as a distinct discipline by the programmatic vision of individual biochemists and of patrons and competitors in related disciplines. It shows how discipline builders used research programmes as strategies that they adapted to the opportunities offered by changing educational markets and national medical reform movements in the United States, Britain and Germany. The author argues that the priorities and styles of various departments and schools of biochemistry reflect systematic social relationships between that discipline and biology, chemistry and medicine.

Not surprisingly, altered metabolic function is associated with a wide spectrum of dysfunctions in the central nervous system \u2013 including developmental disorders, acute nervous system injury, and neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, metabolism-based therapies offer significant promise as new category of treatment options designed to limit, delay or reverse the disease process by reconstructing homeostatic functions. Increasingly it is appreciated that restoring metabolic health could promote normal nervous system activity, and improve behavior and cognition. Adenosine: A Key Link Between Metabolism and Central Nervous System Activity focusses on diverse aspects of adenosine, an evolutionarily conserved homeostatic bioenergetic regulator in the central nervous system. Because of its interrelationship with ATP (adenosine triphosphate), adenosine is integral to cell metabolism. At the same time, adenosine influences neuronal activity directly via receptors, and is involved in biochemical processes related to gene expression. Thus, adenosine is uniquely placed as a reciprocal and rapid link between changes in metabolism and changes in neuronal activity, and, on a longer time scale, to changes in gene expression and long term changes in cell function. Leaders in the field feature basic research on adenosine at the cellular level in the central nervous system, and relate these findings to its recognized potential in diverse acute and chronic disorders. This comprehensive overview of adenosine also highlights emerging adenosine-based treatments and associated opportunities for central nervous system disorders.", "categories": "Chemistry - Biochemistry", "year": "2013", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer-Verlag New York", "language": "english", "pages": "680", "ISBN13": "9781461439035", "file": "PDF, 7.93 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2196429", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2196429/4622d2"},

Their bioinorganic chemistry and analytical determination, the solid state structures of bio-ligand complexes and the properties of alkali metal ions in solution in the context of all kinds of biologically relevant ligands are covered, this includes proteins (enzymes) and nucleic acids (G-quadruplexes). Minerals containing sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) are abundant in the Earth's crust, making Na+ and K+ easily available. In contrast, the alkali elements lithium (Li+), rubidium, and cesium are rare and the radioactive francium occurs only in traces. Since the intra- and extracellular, as well as the compartmental concentrations of Na+ and K+ differ significantly, homeostasis and active transport of these ions are important; this involves transporters/carriers and pore-forming ion channel proteins. Systems like Na+/K+-ATPases, H+/K+-ATPases or Na+/H+ antiporters are thoroughly discussed. The role of K+ in photosynthesis and the role of Na+ in charging the \"battery of life\" are pointed out. Also, the relationships between alkali metal ions and diseases (e.g., Parkinson or traumatic brain injury) are covered and the relevance of Li+ salts in medicine (pharmacology and mechanism) is reviewed. This and more is treated in an authoritative and timely manner in the 16 stimulating chapters of Volume 16, The Alkali Metal Ions: Their Role for Life, which are written by 44 internationally recognized experts from 12 nations.

The majority of students studying organic chemistry, however, are doing so because they are majoring in biology, biochemistry, or health sciences. They need to learn about the structure and reactivity of organic compounds because, quite simply, organic chemistry is the chemistry of life. What is most interesting and relevant to these students is the organic chemistry that takes place in the context of a living cell.In this online textbook, a unique approach is taken to the study of organic chemistry. To the greatest extent possible, biological molecules and biochemical reactions are used to explain and illustrate the central concepts of organic chemistry. This novel approach is most evident in chapters 9-17, which cover the main organic reaction mechanisms in a biological context. However, earlier chapters on organic structure and spectroscopy also focus as much as possible on examples of interest to students of biology and the health sciences. The chemistry of lab synthesis is not ignored - however, these examples are generally grouped together in subsections and introduced to illustrate parallels between laboratory and biological chemistry.This is a dynamic textbook, meaning that it will be continuously undergoing revision in response to reader input.

The text repeats some of what is in the drawings and adds further basic information. It is not intended to try to replace existing textbooks of biochemistry, but to provide students with a tool with which they can revise rapidly, economically and with confidence. It will also serve as a useful introductory book for those who do not need a great deal of detail about biochemistry. It is therefore aimed at the student who wants essential information available literally at a glance. The scope of the book reflects the standard core curriculum of the pre-clinical medical course in biochemistry. Whilst its closest relationship is to the course at UMDS, the harmonisation of teaching across the principal medical schools and the authors' scrutiny of other courses means that the book will be ideally suited to all medical students. Each chapter will be read by an expert in the relevant field before submission of the final manuscript and the text will be written to take into account the recent publication of 'Metabolism at a Glance' with which there might otherwise be a degree of overlap", "categories": "Chemistry - Biochemistry", "year": "1996", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Wiley-Blackwell", "language": "english", "pages": "118", "ISBN10": "0865429804", "ISBN13": "9780865429802", "file": "PDF, 15.35 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1063938", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1063938/adcba6"},
