In its one hundred-year fight against the ever-changing tactics of organized crime and terrorism, the FBI has learned invaluable lessons about powerful leadership and management. Like many companies, the FBI must succeed on a global playing field with limited resources; it must deal with unforeseen challenges and long-term strategic threats. Former Marine Dan Carrison has had unprecedented access to the inner workings of the FBI. Here he offers an insider\u2019s look at the Bureau, taking readers behind the scenes of some of the FBI\u2019s most important missions\u2014from infiltrating a world-wide drug cartel to closing in on a terrorist cell. Managers will learn how to:     cultivate an \u201cAll for One, One for All\u201d corporate culture \u2022 create a Ten-Most-Want\u00aded customer list \u2022 maintain a sense of readiness, and think on their feet \u2022 deploy task force management \u2022 and more     Instructive and exciting, From the Bureau to the Boardroom will show all leaders how to win in the marketplace and stay true to core values, no matter how tense or challenging the situation.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2009", "language": "english", "pages": "272 / 273", "ISBN10": "0814410634", "ISBN13": "9780814410806", "file": "PDF, 660 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/916940", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/916940/1e5d3b"},

A year later, Continental Airlines, one of the top ten carriers in the United States, claims a deficit when the union resists plans to cut labor costs. Later still, oil powerhouse Texaco cries broke rather than pay damages resulting from a courtroom defeat by archrival Pennzoil.Bankruptcy, once a term that sent shudders up a manager's spine, has now become a potent weapon in the corporate arsenal. In his timely and challenging study, Kevin Delaney explores this profound change in our legal landscape, where corporations with billions of dollars in assets employ bankruptcy to achieve specific political and organizational objectives. As a consequence, bankruptcy court is rapidly becoming an arena in which crucial social issues are resolved: How and when will people dying of asbestos poisoning be compensated? Can companies unilaterally break legally negotiated labor contracts? What are the ethical and legal rules of the corporate takeover game?In probing the Chapter 11 bankruptcies of Johns-Manville, Frank Lorenzo's Continental Airlines, and Texaco, Delaney shows not only that bankruptcy is pursued by managers more and more as a strategy, but that it is becoming accepted by the business community as a viable option, and not just a last-ditch solution.This searing expos? of current corporate practices will incite debate among corporate executives, lawyers, legislators, and policy makers.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "1999", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0520073592", "ISBN13": "9780585092737", "file": "EPUB, 422 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1065074/ebee1c"},

Not only do they look good, but they can also feel good because they are helping US workers earn a decent wage (never mind that some of those female workers have accused their boss of sexual harassment). And when shoppers put on a pair of Timberlands, they feel fashionable and as green as the pine forest they might trek through\u2014that is, until they\u2019re reminded that this green company is in the business of killing cows. But surely even the pickiest, most organic, most politically correct buyers can feel virtuous about purchasing a tube of Tom\u2019s toothpaste, right? After all, with its natural ingredients that have never been tested on animals, this company has a forty-year history of being run by a nice couple from Maine . . . well, ahem, until it was recently bought out by Colgate.  \u00a0 It\u2019s difficult to define what makes a company hip and also ethical, but some companies seem to have hit that magic bull\u2019s-eye. In this age of consumer activism, pinpoint marketing, and immediate information, consumers demand everything from the coffee, computer, or toothpaste they buy. They want an affordable, reliable product manufactured by a company that doesn\u2019t pollute, saves energy, treats its workers well, and doesn't hurt animals\u2014oh, and that makes them feel cool when they use it. Companies would love to have that kind of reputation, and a handful seem to have achieved it. But do they deserve their haloes? Can a company make a profit doing so? And how can consumers avoid being tricked by phony marketing?  \u00a0 In Ethical Chic, award-winning author Fran  Hawthorne uses her business-investigative skills to analyze six favorites: Apple, Starbucks, Trader Joe\u2019s, American Apparel, Timberland, and Tom\u2019s of Maine. She attends a Macworld conference and walks on the factory floors of American Apparel. She visits the wooded headquarters of Timberland, speaks to consumers who drive thirty miles to get their pretzels and plantains from Trader Joe\u2019s, and confronts the founders of Tom\u2019s of Maine. More than a how-to guide for daily dilemmas and ethical business practices, Ethical Chic is a blinders-off and nuanced look at the mixed bag of values on sale at companies that project a seemingly progressive image.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Beacon Press", "language": "english", "pages": "224", "ISBN10": "0807000949", "ISBN13": "9780807000946", "file": "EPUB, 277 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2192123/b9b734"},

The roles of the state and the market and how they interrelate are considered in this book against a background of increased intervention by international institutions. The potential contribution of individual citizens and non-governmental organisations towards achieving a socially and environmentally responsible business behaviour is also given attention. These issues are of special concern in an era that calls for different political and regulatory activities than have been exploited traditionally.Highlighting the central importance of law, legal systems and the role of lawyers to the debate on CSR, this book will be of great interest to academics and policymakers.

Simultaneously, due to recent shifts from industrial to service-oriented post-industrial societies, labor as a significant culture code is increasingly loosing importance. Because of this, the third or voluntary sector as a place of employment and as a service agency to society has become important for Europe as indicated by the 1997 Communication of the European Commission and various declarations by the European Parliament and the EU's Economic and Social Council. Strategy Mix for Nonprofit Organizations: Vehicles for Social and Labor Market Integration explores the role of the third sector in Europe, where unemployment is high and in North America, where unemployment is rising and exploring the \"gaps\" that the third sector is fulfilling: both as a social service and as an employer. The volume is organized into two distinctive parts. Part 1: The Nonprofit-Sector and Social Integration highlights the embeddedness of the sector in selected countries; it discusses how the sector is currently affected by changes of public policy particularly in the traditional social-democratic welfare state regimes, and it draws our attention to the sector's potentials to provide avenues for social integration, self-actualization and civic empowerment. Part 2: Labor Concepts and Market Integration refers to the multifunctionality of third sector organizations discussing potentials of workplace as well as community involvement via nonprofit organizations. This seminal volume will be of interest to those in the nonprofit sector, organizational management and economics, political scientists and other researchers working with nonprofit organizations and civil society studies on an international level.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2004", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer US", "language": "english", "pages": "320 / 319", "ISBN13": "9781441968586", "file": "PDF, 15.12 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2133938", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2133938/00570d"},

These ideas, linked with the knowledge of the workforce, are rapidly becoming the primary source of competitive advantage in the world economy.  The book provides an in-depth look at eight Japanese-affiliated manufacturing facilities operating in the United States, combined with examinations of their sister facilities in Japan.  The authors offer their insights into the complex process by which elements of work systems in one country interact with those in another. They trace the flow of ideas from Japan to the US and other nations, and the beginnings of a reverse diffusion of innovation back to Japan.  The authors organize their findings into six categories: the cross-cultural diffusion of work practices, team-based work systems, kaizen and employee involvement, employment security, human resource management, and labor-management relations. Their study of team-based work systems yields a taxonomy of teams and reveals some conflicts between the desire for self-management and the existence of interdependencies.  Investigations into kaizen (ongoing incremental improvement) indicate that its emphasis on employee-driven, systematic problem solving makes it a strong counterpoint to the idea of top-down \"re-engineering.\"  Looking at employment security, the authors note that while most US managers believe that it restrains managerial flexibility, managers at the firms they observed see it as essential to the flexibility associated with teamwork and kaizen. The study of human resource management practices suggests competitive advantages in diverse, older, unionized, and urban work forces, and emphasizes the importance of wide-ranging training programs in a work system premised on a long-term perspective.  The \"wildcard\" in the work places observed is labor-management relations, the area in which Japanese managers have been least likely to import their ideas.  The authors report on several situations in which existing labor-management structures remained untouched, with mixed results: greater labor-management consultation, for example, but also increased ambiguity of roles.  The thread running through all of these areas of work is \"virtual knowledge,\" an ephemeral form of knowledge derived from a particular combination of people focused on a given issue.  The authors point out that this powerful form of knowledge is only effectively harnessed in environments that are free of fear, that have established procedures for collective problem-solving, and that have some stability in group composition.

Impact investing was a simple idea: private money is invested to build resilient economies in places as diverse as Ghana, Mexico, Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Kenya and the Middle East to improve healthcare, education, clean energy and access to consumer goods, while delivering returns for investors. The Abraaj Group (Abraaj means 'towers' in Arabic) had just shy of $14 billion under management by 2017; they were on the threshold of closing a new fund that would invest $6 billion into these emerging markets. One of their most successful investments had been in Karachi Electric, the sale of which had been agreed to a Chinese energy giant, and a sizeable chunk of that new fund was going to come from Chinese investors. Then Donald Trump entered the White House, China became corporate enemy number one and the President's friends in private equity, who wanted a piece of the emerging markets action, could now see a way to get it. What followed was straight from the US playbook of deploying economic hitmen to annihilate their commercial and geopolitical enemies, culminating on 10 April 2019 with Arif Naqvi being arrested at Heathrow Airport in a joint UK-US operation seeking his extradition to the United States. The dominant media narrative has painted Naqvi as an evil genius, the so-called key man in an organised criminal conspiracy that is alleged to have lasted years but actually amounts to potential regulatory breaches which are usually dealt with, for those who are 'one of us', by fines and reprimands rather than threats of hundreds of years in jail. However, in this extraordinary investigation based on extensive documentary research and dozens of interviews with the key players, Brian Brivati sets out to provide rather different answers to the key questions that comprise this tale.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2021", "publisher": "Biteback Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "320", "ISBN10": "1785907182", "file": "PDF, 1.98 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/16746647", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16746647/bb1660"},

His provocative examination addresses essential issues facing American businesses today as they compete in the new international marketplace. Why are large American corporations owned by hundreds of relatively small stockholders, while a handful of stockholders control big blocks of stock in German and Japanese corporations? Why are banks and other potentially large investors restricted by law from owning controlling interests in American corporations? Why are senior managers of US firms so powerful, while the actual owners are frequently far removed from day-to-day business, even when they are large financial institutions? These questions are debated regularly in both popular and scholarly media. This book provides the historical background to the discussion. This text offers a new perspective on the corporate upheavals of the 1980s and 1990s, when relationships among shareholders, boardrooms, and senior managers were thrown into upheaval.  Numerous proposals are debated daily in the business press about how the relationships among these three groups should change to make corporations more productive and more effective competitors in the world market. Roe argues that lasting change will be difficult to achieve without understanding how political and social forces created and shaped the modern American corporation.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "1994", "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "341", "ISBN10": "0691036837", "ISBN13": "9780691036830", "file": "PDF, 2.99 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1265786", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1265786/00d3e6"},

It was a juggernaut, the first retailer to sell $1 billion in goods, the owner of nearly sixteen thousand stores and dozens of factories and warehouses. But its explosive growth made it a mortal threat to hundreds of thousands of mom-and-pop grocery stores. Main Street fought back tooth and nail, enlisting the state and federal governments to stop price discounting, tax chain stores, and require manufacturers to sell to mom and pop at the same prices granted to giant retailers. In a remarkable court case, the federal government pressed criminalcharges against the Great A&P for selling food too cheaply\u2014and won. \u00a0The Great A&P and the Struggle for Small Business in America is the story of a stunningly successful company that forever changed how Americans shop and what Americans eat.

The firm--buttressed by the most aggressive and sophisticated p.r. machine in the financial industry--often boasts of \"The Goldman Way,\" a business model predicated on hiring the most talented people, indoctrinating them in a corporate culture where partners stifle their egos for the greater good, and honoring the \"14 Principles,\" the first of which is \"Our clients' interests always come first.\"\u00a0But there is another way of viewing Goldman--a secretive money-making machine that has straddled the line between conflict-of-interest and legitimate deal-making for decades; a firm that has exerted undue influence over government since the early part of the 20th century; a company composed of \"cyborgs\" who are kept in line by an internal \"reputational risk department\" staffed by former CIA operatives and private investigators; a workplace rife with brutal power struggles; a Wall Street titan whose clever bet against the mortgage market in 2007--a bet not revealed to its clients--may have made the financial ruin of the Great Recession\u00a0worse.\u00a0As William D. Cohan shows in his riveting chronicle of Goldman's rise to the summit of world capitalism, the firm has shown a remarkable ability to weather financial crises, congressional, federal and SEC investigations, and numerous lawsuits, all with its reputation and its enormous profits intact.\u00a0By\u00a0reading thousands of pages of government documents, court cases, SEC filings, Freedom of Information Act\u00a0papers\u00a0and other sources, and conducting over 100 interviews, including interviews with clients, competitors, regulators, current and former Goldman employees (including the\u00a0six\u00a0living men who have run Goldman), Cohan has constructed a vivid narrative that looks behind the veil of secrecy to reveal how Goldman has become so profitable, and so powerful.\u00a0Part of the answer is the firm's assiduous cultivation of people in power--dating back to 1913, when Henry Goldman advised the government on how the new Federal Reserve, designed to oversee Wall Street, should be constituted.\u00a0Sidney Weinberg, who ran the firm for four decades, advised presidents from Roosevelt to Kennedy and was nicknamed \"The Politician\" for his behind-the-scenes friendships with government officials.\u00a0 Goldman executives ran fundraising efforts for Nixon, Reagan, Clinton and George W. Bush.\u00a0 The firm showered lucrative consulting\u00a0or speaking fees on figures like Henry Kissinger and Lawrence Summers. Famously, and fatefully, two Goldman leaders-- Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson--became Secretaries of the Treasury, where their\u00a0actions both before and\u00a0during the financial crisis of 2008\u00a0became the stuff of controversy and conspiracy theories.\u00a0\u00a0Another major strand in the firm's DNA is its eagerness to deal on both sides of a transaction, eliding questions of conflict of interest by the mere assertion of their innate honesty and nobility, a refrain repeated many times in its history, most notoriously by current Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein's jesting assertion that he was doing \"God's work.\"\u00a0As Michiko Kakutani's New York Times review of HOUSE OF CARDS said, \"Cohan writes with an insider's knowledge of the workings of Wall Street, a reporter's investigative instincts and a natural storyteller's narrative command.\" In MONEY & POWER, Cohan has marshaled all these gifts in a powerful and definitive account of an institution whose public claims of virtue look very much like ruthlessness when exposed to the light of day.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Doubleday", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "038552384X", "ISBN13": "9780385523844", "file": "EPUB, 2.70 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1184870/54045a"},

But corporations are also the cause of immense suffering, instruments of poverty, pollution, and financial crisis. And these problems are on the increase. Colin Mayer, distinguished financial economist, former Dean and now Professor of Management Studies at the Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford University, shows why this is happening and what we can do to restore trust in corporationsWhat we need, he contends, are corporations whose values we all value, for which we are proud to work, from which we are confident to purchase, and in which we can expect a fair return on our investments.  We need shareholders who appreciate that there are responsibilities as well as rewards for being owners and who are committed to promoting the interests of the corporation, not just their own. And we need firms to specify their values and principles clearly and precisely, and to establish boards of directors charged with upholding those values effectively.Using examples and stories from history and around the modern world, Mayer illuminates the essential elements that define a corporation and are the source of its problems - ownership, governance, accountability, and trust - and sets out an ambitious agenda for change. He challenges governments, corporations, shareholders and consumers to convert the corporation into a twenty-first century organization that we can trust to promote the interests of economies and societies around the world.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "192", "ISBN10": "0199669937", "ISBN13": "9780199669936", "file": "MOBI , 330 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2191889/95681a"},

Ever since its \"I'd like to teach the world to sing\" commercials from the 1970s, Coca-Cola has billed itself as the world's beverage, uniting all colors and cultures in a mutual love of its caramel-sweet sugar water. The formula has worked incredibly well-making it one of the most profitable companies on the planet and \"Coca-Cola\" the world's second- most recognized word after \"hello.\" However, as the company expands its reach into both domestic and foreign markets, an increasing number of the world's citizens are finding the taste of Coke more bitter than sweet.  Journalist Michael Blanding's The Coke Machine probes shocking accusations about the company's global impact, including:  \u2022 Coca-Cola's history of winning at any cost, even if it meant that its franchisees were making deals with the Nazis and Guatemalan paramilitary squads  \u2022 How Coke has harmed children's health and contributed to an obesity epidemic through exclusive soda contracts in schools  \u2022 The horrific environmental impact of Coke bottling plants in India and Mexico, where water supplies have been decimated while toxic pollution has escalated  \u2022 That Coke bottlers stand accused of conspiring with paramilitaries to threaten, kidnap, and murder union leaders in their bottling plants in Colombia  A disturbing portrait drawn from an award-winning journalist's daring, in-depth research, The Coke Machine is the first comprehensive probe of the company and its secret formula for greed.

Ballard was a literary giant. His novels were unique and surprising. To the journalists and admirers who sought him out, Ballard was the 'seer of Shepperton'; his home the vantage from which he observed the rising suburban tide, part of a changing society captured and second-guessed so plausibly in his fiction. Such acuity was not exclusive to his novels and, as this book reminds us, Ballard's restive intelligence sharpened itself in dialogue. He entertained many with insights into the world as he saw it, and speculated, often correctly, about its future. Some of these observations earned Ballard an oracular reputation, and continue to yield an uncannily accurate commentary today. Now, for the first time, 'Extreme Metaphors' collects the finest interviews of his career. Conversations with cultural figureheads such as Will Self, Jon Savage, Iain Sinclair and John Gray, and collaborators like David Cronenberg, are a reminder of his wit and humanity, testament to Ballard's profound worldliness as much as his otherworldly imagination. This collection is an indispensable tribute to one of recent history's most incisive and original thinkers.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Fourth Estate", "language": "english", "pages": "528", "ISBN10": "0007454856", "ISBN13": "9780007454853", "file": "EPUB, 2.27 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2220979/b9a417"},

Her portrait of the chameleonlike artist is much more than an account of Bowles's life, however. It is also a meditation on biography that questions the biographer's role, the subject's credibility, and the very nature of \"truth\" in the telling of a life.Millicent Dillon first met Paul Bowles in Tangier in 1977, when she was writing a biography of his wife, the author Jane Bowles, who died in 1973. Dillon returned to Morocco in 1992 to work with Bowles on a book about his own life. In Bowles's book-lined apartment often crowded with visitors, Dillon observes the magnetism the aging artist exerts on anyone who comes into his circle. Bowles talks of his difficult childhood and of his grief over Jane's long illness, of exile, dreams, and madness. He is charming and evasive with Dillon, generous and devious. As the book unfolds, Dillon's own reflections and concerns surface alongside details of Bowles's daily life, his physical condition, his interactions with others. Her portrait of the artist is seen simultaneously with her construction of that portrait, and in a kind of literary legerdemain we are able to observe Dillon on the biographical canvas along with Bowles and his deceased wife.Author of the international bestseller The Sheltering Sky and numerous other works, as well as an acclaimed composer, Paul Bowles has had an immensely rich creative life. Millicent Dillon seems to have been destined to write this unconventional biography of the artist, and the result is wonderful, disturbing, and strangely compelling, like Paul Bowles himself.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2000", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "354 / 89", "ISBN10": "0520224930", "ISBN13": "9780520224933", "file": "PDF, 592 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/913173", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/913173/e53fed"},

The self-made sultan of Times Square, he ruled over this mythic realm of sin and corruption for decades, chronicling its forbidden pleasures in the pages of his trailblazing sex paper Screw and making them accessible to millions. His story is the stuff of the American Dream. An overweight cab driver and welfare recipient who founded Screw and became the most outspoken figurehead of the sex revolution, Goldstein went on to become a multi-millionaire and tireless opponent of all things \"establishment.\u201d Here was a man who had sex with the world's most famous porn starlets, rubbed elbows with literary lions such as Henry Miller and Phillip Roth, attended celebrity orgies with the likes of Gay Talese, partied with Hugh Hefner at the Playboy mansion and then lost it all, morphing into America's most famous homeless drifter of the new millennium. He threw his heart, soul and fortune into a series of bruising First Amendment battles and became a folk hero to the disgruntled masses, giving the finger to the world as ex-wives drained him and fired ex-employees and unwitting targets of his vicious satires who couldn't take a joke sued him. Cabbies, waiters and cops on the beat cheered him when he appeared on the street.  The Al Goldstein story stars a cast of thousands of hookers, hustlers and porn starlets, with key guest parts played by equally colourful characters. In addition to getting up-close-and-personal to Goldstein in a way that lends heretofore unavailable detail and context to the story, Beneath Contempt charts Screw's emergence from the underground press scene and gauges its achievements as a catalyst of counterculture rebellion. It surveys mid-70s porn chic and illumes Screw's increasingly lonely crusade for total freedom of sexual expression, covering the court battles in the late 70s and touching on the downfall of Times Square in word and image. Finally, the stunning and total collapse of his business empire and personal life is mapped out in meticulous detail, as is his ascension from the ashes and his run for the presidency in 2008. The movies Al was in over the years, the bizarre spin-off papers he published, such as Mobster Times and Death Magazine , the erratic personal behaviour -  it's all here in this readable and lavishly illustrated profile of America's last angry dirty old man.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Headpress", "language": "english", "pages": "216 / 221", "ISBN10": "1900486792", "ISBN13": "9781900486798", "file": "PDF, 6.15 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2216906", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2216906/77dc49"},

Not in the way that most kids do, but in an irrepressible, all-consuming, I-want-to-climb-inside-the-tube kind of way. And climb inside he did. Now presiding over Bravo's reality TV empire, he started out as an overly talkative pop culture obsessive, devoted to Charlie's Angels and All My Children and to his mother, who received daily letters from Andy\u00a0at summer camp, usually reminding her to tape the soaps. In retrospect, it's hard to believe that everyone didn't know that Andy was gay; still, he remained in the closet until college. Finally out, he embarked on making a career out of his passion for television. The journey begins with Andy interviewing his all-time idol Susan Lucci for his college newspaper and ends with him in a job where he has a hand in creating today's celebrity icons. In the witty, no-holds-barred style of his show Watch What Happens Live, Andy tells tales of absurd mishaps during his ten years at CBS News, hilarious encounters with the heroes and heroines of his youth, and the real stories behind The Real Housewives.

These are just a few of the film adaptations that have been made from the terrifying and eerie work of novelist and short story writer Stephen King. It is nearly impossible to think of another author who has inspired so many, and such diverse filmmakers\u2014yet there has never before been a work by a film specialist that focused solely on Stephen King. Mark Browning, in Stephen King on the Big Screen, takes a film-by-film approach to exploring why some adaptations of King\u2019s work are more successful than others. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Browning discusses every single film adaptation given a global cinematic release\u2014including films by such well-known directors as Stanley Kubrick, George A. Romero, and David Cronenberg. His is the first book to consider in detail Sleepwalkers, Dreamcatcher, and 1408 as well as the much-neglected portmanteau films and touchstones\u00a0like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. In a highly readable and engaging style, Browning examines how different film directors have interpreted and translated the original literary texts into a new medium. Throughout, he reveals the elements of style and approach that have helped make King one of the world\u2019s best-selling authors. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This entertaining and accessible guide to the complete corpus of Stephen King films is a must-have for fans of his fiction and of the many directors who have sought to capture his macabre stories and bizarre characters in cinematic form.

A black American radical who was born Alan Donaldson in a Boston ghetto and reborn in prison as a follower of Malcolm X, Hakim took the movie star Jean Seberg as lover, wrote and published the story of his life, and finally came to believe that he was God. Diana Athill, a well known British editor, liked the man in Hakim, and saw the book in his life. She became his friend, briefly his lover, and then watched with dismay as he slowly destroyed his prospects, alienated his friends, and exploited his young English girlfriend, Gail Benson, the daughter of a Member of Parliament.Benson changed her name to Hale Kimga to please Hakim and followed him to Trinidad, where she was brutally murdered in 1972. The crime caused a sensation at the time and was later incorporated by V.S. Naipual in his novel, Guerrillas. Hakim himself was shot to death in Boston a few years later, and not long afterward Jean Seberg killed herself in Paris. But from this sad cautionary tale it is the voice of Diana Athill that the reader may best remember - cool, direct, vivid, honest, unblinking.

The New Yorker cost 75 cents. And on the cover unfolded Saul Steinberg's vision of the world: New York City, the Hudson River, and then...well, it's really just a bunch of stuff you needn't concern yourself with. Steinberg's brilliant depiction of the world according to self-satisfied New Yorkers placed him squarely in the pantheon of the magazine's\u2014and the era's\u2014most celebrated artists. \u00a0But if you look beyond the searing wit and stunning artistry, you'll find one of the most fascinating lives of the twentieth century. Born in Romania, Steinberg was educated in Milan and\u00a0was already famous for his satirical drawings when World War II forced him to immigrate to the United States. On a single day, Steinberg became a US citizen, a commissioned officer in the US Navy, and a member of the OSS, assigned to spy in China, North Africa, and Italy. After the war ended, he returned to America and to his art. He quickly gained entree into influential circles that included Saul Bellow, Vladimir Nabokov, Willem de Kooning, and Le Corbusier. His wife was the artist Hedda Sterne, from whom he\u00a0separated in 1960 but never divorced and with whom he remained in daily contact for the rest of\u00a0his life. This conveniently freed him up to amass a coterie of young mistresses and lovers. But his truly great love was the United States, where\u00a0he traveled extensively by bus, train, and car, drawing, observing, and writing. \u00a0His body of work is staggering and influential in ways we may not yet even be able to fully grasp, quite possibly because there has not been a full-scale biography of him until now.\u00a0Deirdre Bair had access to 177 boxes of documents and more than 400 drawings. In addition, she conducted several hundred personal interviews. Steinberg's curious talent for creating myths about himself did not make her job\u00a0an easy one, but the result is a stunning achievement\u00a0to admire and enjoy.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Nan A.

No longer just a name, \"Oprah\" has become a brand representing the talk show host's unique style of self-actualizing individualism. The cultural and economic power wielded by Winfrey merits critical evaluation. The contributors to The Oprah Phenomenon examine the origins of her public image and its substantial influence on politics, entertainment, and popular opinion. Contributors address praise from her many supporters and weigh criticisms from her detractors. Winfrey's ability to create a feeling of intimacy with her audience has long been cited as one of the foundations of her popularity. She has repeatedly made national headlines by engaging and informing her audience with respect to her personal relationships to race, gender, feminism, and New Age culture. The Oprah Phenomenon explores these relationships in detail. At the root of Winfrey's message to her vast audience is her assertion that anyone can be a success regardless of background or upbringing. The contributors scrutinize this message: What does this success entail? Is the motivation behind self-actualization, in fact, merely the hope of replicating Winfrey's purchasing power? Is it just a prescription to buy the products she recommends and heed the advice of people she admires, or is it a lifestyle change of meaningful spiritual benefit? The Oprah Phenomenon asks these and many other difficult questions to promote a greater understanding of Winfrey's influence on the American consciousness.

Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an \"excitement addict.\" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.   Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.   What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.   For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.

It is new in several ways, most notably in the way it approaches the life of the poet. Paying its proper respect to the classic lives of Wordsworth by Mary Moorman and Stephen Gill, it attempts to tell the story of the life through a more rigorous reading of key and representative works of the poet, through careful blending of life and poetry. Wordsworth offers the story of the literariness of the poet's life - childhood and adolescence in the Lake District, education at Cambridge, love and political radicalism in France, the long period of residence in Grasmere and Rydal, celebrity, and national and international recognition. Its reading of the poems, in tune with current theoretical practice, offers a sense of the continuities in Wordsworth's career as it moves away from familiar theories of a Golden Decade of creativity and a period of long decline. The book also works closely and rigorously with Wordsworth's poetry as a method of dramatizing the essentially poetic character of the poet's life.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "1996", "edition": "2", "publisher": "Fordham University Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0823217167", "ISBN13": "9780585125695", "file": "EPUB, 731 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1077855/bd0178"},

Lange provided what Stern had yet to find all in the same place: a wit quick enough to keep pace with his own, a pathetic self-image to dwarf his own, a personal history both heartbreaking and hilarious, and an ingrained sense of self-sabotage that continually keeps things interesting. A natural storyteller with a bottomless pit of material, Lange grew up in a close-knit, working-class Italian family in Union, New Jersey, a maniacal Yankees fan who pursued the two things his father said he was cut out for\u2014sports and comedy. Tragically, Artie Lange Sr. never saw the truth in that prediction: He became a quadriplegic in an accident when Artie was eighteen and died soon after. But as with every trial in his life, from his drug addiction to his obesity to his fights with his mother, Artie mines the humor, pathos, and humanity in these events and turns them into comedy classics. True fans of the Stern Show will find Artie gold in these pages: hilarious tales that couldn\u2019t have happened to anyone else. There are stories from his days driving a Jersey cab, working as a longshoreman in Port Newark, and navigating the dark circuit of stand-up comedy. There are outrageous episodes from the frenzied heights of his coked-up days at MADtv, surprisingly moving stories from his childhood, and an account of his recent U.S.O. tour that is equally stirring and irreverent. But also in this volume are stories Artie\u2019s never told before, including some that he deemed too revealing for radio. Wild, shocking, and drop-dead hilarious, Too Fat to Fish is Artie Lange giving everything he\u2019s got to give.

For nearly the last twenty-five years of Igor Stravinsky's incredibly full life, the noted musician, conductor, and writer Robert Craft was his closest colleague and friend, a trusted member of his household, and an important part of all of the composer's activities. Throughout these years, Craft kept a detailed diary, impressive in its powers of observation and characterization. That diary forms the basis for Stravinsky: Chronicle of a Friendship, now released in a substantially revised and expanded new edition. This edition includes nearly twice as many illustrations and more than 35% entirely new textual material. In addition, Craft adds an evocative \"Postlude\" in which he summarily brings matters forward to the death of Vera Stravinsky, several years after that of the Maestro.  Anyone interested in Stravinsky and his music, in Stravinsky's relationship with Craft, and in many of the luminaries and landmarks of twentieth-century Western cultural history will find this book essential reading.

Meet Robert Englund, the award-winning actor best known for his role as Freddy Krueger -- the legendary horror icon featured on the American Film Institute's \"100 Greatest Heroes and Villains\" roster -- a character as unforgettable and enduring as Bela Lugosi's Dracula and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein. Now, for the first time, the man behind the latex mask tells his story in this captivating new memoir, published to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first A Nightmare on Elm Street film.   You see, Robert Englund is no monster at all, but a deeply funny, charming Hollywood veteran. Packed with Robert's hilarious stories, playful self-deprecation, and a generous helping of never-before-revealed A Nightmare on Elm Street trivia, Hollywood Monster offers an unparalleled look at the beloved film icon. With insider savvy and gallows humor, Robert recounts his audition for Wes Craven, the inspiration for Freddy's character, the grueling makeup sessions, his soon-to-be-famous costars, the often disastrous on-set blunders, and the wave of popularity that propelled this humble California surfer kid all the way to the top.   Of course, fame and fortune as Freddy came years after the young actor shared a trailer with screen legend Henry Fonda, was punched in the face by Richard Gere, took down Burt Reynolds, and muscled his way between Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sally Field, and Jeff Bridges.   But soon after his high-profile stint in the groundbreaking TV miniseries V, Robert Englund took on the most celebrated role of his career -- the macabre and wisecracking killer who quickly became a household name.

Wayne's career did have its share of controversy (although he starred in cutthroat war films, Wayne didn't sign up for military service in WWII; he rejected communism, which made him the object of Stalinist threats; and the actor's given name is still debated), and Munn deftly addresses those hullabaloos while providing an overview of the actor's accomplishments. After playing football at USC, Wayne worked as a studio prop man, coming into early contact with director John Ford, who would direct Wayne in some of his most memorable performances, including 1952's The Quiet Man. Throughout their association, Ford treated Wayne erratically, disparaging his talents and lashing out at him for accepting a lead role from rival director Raoul Walsh (The Big Trail, 1930). Yet Ford and Wayne collaborated on 1939's Stagecoach, which gave birth to the serious western and the Ford-Wayne movie subgenre. Other highlights include Wayne's emergence as a heavy in 1948's Red River and his ferocious performance in 1956's The Searchers. Munn portrays the actor in his personal life as a man's man, who sustained friendships with tough cohorts like stuntman Yakima Canutt but failed in romance. Although the book takes an odd turn toward the end, when Munn links Wayne's patriotism and heroic persona to the heroic actions after September 11, overall, it's a fine tribute.

In her celebrated novels and short stories, she has probed the intersection of prejudice and oppression with a rare and striking lyricism.  In her first book-length collection of nonfiction, Cliff displays the same poetic intensity, interweaving reflections on her life in Jamaica, England, and the United States with a powerful and sustained critique of racism, homophobia, and social injustice. If I Could Write This in Fire begins by tracing her transatlantic journey from Jamaica to England, coalescing around a graceful, elliptical account of her childhood friendship with Zoe, who is dark-skinned and from an impoverished, rural background; the divergent life courses that each is forced to take; and the class and color tensions that shape their lives as adults. The personal is interspersed with fragments of Jamaica\u2019s history and the plight of people of color living both under imperial rule and in contemporary Britain. In other essays and poems, Cliff writes about the discovery of her distinctive, diasporic literary voice, recalls her wild colonial girlhood and sexual awakening, and recounts traveling through an American landscape of racism, colonialism, and genocide\u2014a history of violence embodied in seemingly innocuous souvenirs and tourist sites.   A profound meditation on place and displacement, If I Could Write This in Fire explores the complexities of identity as they meet with race, gender, sexuality, nationality, and the legacies of the Middle Passage and European imperialism.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2008", "language": "english", "pages": "104", "ISBN10": "0816654743", "ISBN13": "9780816666553", "file": "PDF, 208 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/888297", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/888297/2cde76"},

Evel Knievel was a high-flying daredevil, the father of extreme sports, the personification of excitement and dan\u00adger and showmanship . . . and in the 1970s Knievel repre\u00adsented a unique slice of American culture and patriotism. His jump over the fountains at Caesar\u2019s Palace led to a crash unlike anything ever seen on television, and his attempt to rocket over Snake River Canyon in Idaho was something only P. T. Barnum could have orchestrated. The dazzling motorcycles and red-white-and-blue outfits became an integral part of an American decade. Knievel looked like Elvis . . . but on any given Saturday afternoon millions tuned in to the small screen to see this real-life action hero tempt death.  But behind the flash and the frenzy, who was the man? Bestselling author Leigh Montville masterfully explores the life of the complicated man from the small town of Butte, Montana. He delves into Knievel\u2019s amazing place in pop culture, as well as his notorious dark side\u2014and his complex and often contradictory relationships with his image, the media, his own family, and his many demons. Evel Knievel\u2019s story is an all-American saga, and one that is largely untold.

Bos"], "rating": "0", "description": "In her first book of nonfiction, Julia Alvarez takes us behind the scenes and shares the lessons she's learned on her way to becoming an internationally acclaimed novelist. In 1960, when Alvarez was ten years old, her family fled the Dominican Republic. Her father participated in a failed coup attempt against the dictator Rafael Trujillo, and exile to the United States was the only way to save his life. The family settled in New York City, where Dr. Alvarez set up a medical practice in the Bronx while his wife and four daughters set about the business of assimilation--a lifelong struggle. Loss of her native land, language, culture, and extended family formed the thematic basis for two of Julia Alvarez's three best-selling novels--HOW THE GARCIA GIRLS LOST THEIR ACCENTS and its sequel, YO! Her father's revolutionary ties inspired IN THE TIME OF THE BUTTERFLIES, her historical novel about one of Trujillo's most infamous atrocities. SOMETHING TO DECLARE offers an extraordinary collection of essays that deal with the two big issues of Alvarez's life--growing up with one foot in each culture and writing. The twelve essays that make up \"Customs,\" the first of two parts, examine the specific effects of exile on this writer. The essays are personal--how her maternal grandfather passed along his love of the arts, how the nuclear family-in-exile snuggled down every year to watch the Miss America contest from the parental bed, how Julia feared her family might disown her upon publication of her first novel. In the second half, \"Declarations,\" are twelve essays about writing that range from confession of Alvarez's means of supporting her writing habit to the gritty details of her actual process. Every one of these essays is warm, open, honest, and generous.

It's something like a prequel to Rob Sheffield's first, fantastic memoir, *Love Is a Mix Tape*, taking its cue this time from a musical decade so addictive and eclectic that, as he notes, \"every night in your town, you can find a bar somewhere hosting an Awesome 80s Prom Night.\" This hilarious and heartfelt collection of coming-of-age vignettes is arguably a much more satisfying way to spend an evening, though, particularly if you have even an ounce of the New Wave obsession that courses through it. Sheffield riffs on the songs that saw him through the rapture and misery and bewilderment of being a guy who wanted to understand girls, gleefully skewering Duran Duran along the way (even as he professes his love for them) and paying tribute to tunes that captured some of his best moments. If you're going to revisit your youth, let Rob Sheffield be your guide. Nothing compares to him. *--Anne Bartholomew*     * * *  ## Rob Sheffield's Top '80s Summer Cruising Songs  Reading *Talking to Girls About Duran Duran* is a nostalgia trip you'll love taking: add Rob Sheffield's exclusive playlist to the mix--featured below, with liner notes--and you'll be ready for some kind of wonderful summer night. You can also sample and download these songs in **our custom MP3 playlist. ***     \"Little Red Corvette\" (1982) by Prince*   This was my get-in-the-zone song the morning of my driver's test. Prince seemed to be promising me that as soon as I had wheels, all sorts of glamorously messed-up ladies would be trying to hop a ride uptown in my love machine. It didn't exactly work out that way, but at least I passed the test and got my license. Thanks, Prince!      **\"Missing You\" (1984) by John Waite**   I spent the summer of '84 rolling around Boston in an ice cream truck, selling Bomb Pops and Fudgsicles and Nutty Buddys. And with all due respect to *Scarface*, I got high on my own supply, which means I spent the summer with one hand on the wheel and another one stuffing my face. I was also listening to the radio 18 hours a day, so I got obsessed with this song. I still get choked up at the \"heartbreak overload\" part.      **\"Never Let Me Down Again\" (1987) by Depeche Mode**   It's weird how bizarre sexual tension fits so well with operating a motor vehicle--you really shouldn't try to drive and feel tragic at the same time, right? But they go hand in hand. No song captures that feeling like this one: just you and your best friend, riding high, leaving the rest of the world eating your dust.      **\"Is There Something I Should Know?\" (1983) by Duran Duran**   One summer I worked on a garbage truck on the southeast expressway into Boston, picking up trash on the side of the road: burger wrappers, soda cups, porn mags, the occasional pair of pants. Duran Duran helped get me through it, although I never did figure out what they meant by \"You're about as easy as a nuclear war.\"      **\"It Takes Two\" (1988) by Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock**   This brings back fond memories of 1988, when \"It Takes Two\" was pumping out of every car down my street, with the same \"Whoop!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Whoop!\" \"Yeah!\" James Brown sample rolling on all summer long. Roxanne Shante's \"Go On Girl\" had the same sample, so by the end of the summer it was hard-wired into my neurons.      **\"Our Lips Are Sealed\" (1980) by The Go-Go's**   This song puts anybody in serious danger of a speeding ticket--Gina Schock had to be one of the greatest punk rock drummers who ever banged a gong. I'm sad the Go-Go's had to cancel their farewell tour--but hopefully that just means they'll stick together a little longer.      **\"Hysteria\" (1987) by Def Leppard**   This song always reminds me of a cool girl I hung around with in the summer of 1988. She liked setting things on fire, getting both of us thrown out of bars, and Def Leppard. It's funny because this is a classic hair-metal ballad, but with all these glossy keyboards, it sounds like impeccable '80s synth-pop--it could pass for prime New Order or OMD. (Editor's note: Song is available on album only.)      **\"Left of the Dial\" (1985) by The Replacements**   It was the summer of '86 when I road-tripped to my first Replacements show, in Providence. Paul Westerberg was standing at the bar before the show, so I stole the Kool butt out of his ashtray and mailed it to a girl I liked in Nova Scotia. She wrote back, \"It stinks to high heaven.\" But I guess that was the kind of stupid romantic gesture only a Replacements fan would make.      **\"My Prerogative\" (1989) by Bobby Brown**   Everybody's talking all this stuff about him! Why don't they just let him live! This is a perfectly badass song for prowling the streets, feeling totally invincible. And if the night ends up in the back of a cop car, it makes an excellent soundtrack to kicking out the windows, because that's what Bobby would do.      **\"Wild in the Streets\" (1986) by Bon Jovi**   One of the funny things about Jon Le Bon is that his career album, *Slippery When Wet*, is packed with cruising songs as good as \"Livin\u2019 on a Prayer.\" I always think \"Wild in the Streets\" could have been Bon Jovi's biggest, bonniest and joviest hit, but for some reason they never played it on the radio; it's the one that got away. I also love how Jon yells that nutty \"rock me!\" during the guitar solo. Someday I pray that Morrissey will cover this--and change it to \"Wilde in the Streets.\" A guy can dream.      * * *   From Publishers Weekly  In this tuneful coming-of-age memoir, the glamorous New Wave band Duran Duran presides spiritually over the all-consuming teenage male efforts to comprehend the opposite sex. Music journalist Sheffield (*Love Is a Mix Tape*) chronicles his passage through the 1980s in a series of chapters in which period groups\u2014from headliners like Roxy Music and Prince to one-hit wonders like Haysi Fantayzee of Shiny Shiny semifame\u2014provides musical accompaniment to his adolescent angst. They are the soundtrack to his fumbling attempts to dance or make passes at girls, to weather a winless stint on the high school wrestling team, to survive a summer job as an ice-cream truck driver. The relationship insights he arrives at\u2014chiefly, the imperative of unquestioning submission to female whims\u2014are no more or less cogent than the song lyrics he gleans them from. The book really shines as a collection of free-form riffs on the glorious foolishness of Reagan-era entertainment\u2014the movie *E.T.*, he writes, was about a sad muppet who thought he was David Bowie\u2014and its weirdly resonant emotional impact. The result is a funny, poignant browse from a wonderful pop-culture evocateur. *(July)*    Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He transports the reader to Carnegie's Pittsburgh, where hundreds of smoking furnaces belched smoke into the sky and the air was filled with acrid fumes . . . and mill workers worked seven-day weeks while Carnegie spent months traveling across Europe.Carnegie explores the contradictions in the life of the man who rose from lowly bobbin boy to build the largest and most profitable steel company in the world.

From the principled Amy Fowler Kane in High Noon to the thrill-seeking Frances Stevens of To Catch a Thief, Grace established herself as one of Hollywood\u2019s most talented actresses and iconic beauties. Her astonishing career lasted until her retirement at age twenty-six, when she withdrew from stage and screen to marry a European monarch and became a modern, working princess and mother. Based on never-before-published or quoted interviews with Grace and those conducted over many years with her friends and colleagues\u2013from costars James Stewart and Cary Grant to director Alfred Hitchcock\u2013as well as many documents disclosed by her children for the first time, acclaimed biographer Donald Spoto explores the transformation of a convent schoolgirl to New York model, successful television actress, Oscar-winning movie star, and beloved royal.

Cohen is also a man of complexities and seeming contradictions: a devout Jew, who is also a sophisticate and ladies\u2019 man, as well as an ordained Buddhist monk whose name, Jikan\u2014\u201cordinary silence\u201d\u2014is quite the appellation for a writer and singer whose life has been anything but ordinary.   I\u2019m Your Man is the definitive account of that extraordinary life. Acclaimed music journalist Sylvie Simmons crafts a portrait of Cohen as nuanced as the man himself, drawing on a wealth of research that includes Cohen\u2019s personal archives and more than a hundred exclusive interviews with those closest to Cohen\u2014from his lovers, friends, monks, professors, rabbis and fellow musicians to his muses, including Rebecca De Mornay, Marianne Ihlen, Suzanne Elrod and Suzanne Verdal\u2014and most important, with Cohen himself, whose presence infuses these pages.   Starting in Montreal, Cohen\u2019s birthplace, where he first found fame as a poet in the fifties, Simmons follows his trail, via London and the Greek island of Hydra, to New York in the sixties, where he launched his music career. From there she traces the arc of his prodigious achievements to his remarkable retreat in the mid-nineties\u2014when on the cusp of marriage to a beautiful actress and enjoying the success of his best-selling album to date, he entered a monastery on a rocky mountaintop above Los Angeles\u2014and finally to his reemergence for a sold-out world tour almost fifteen years later. Whether navigating Cohen\u2019s journeys through the back streets of Mumbai or the countless hotel rooms where he has stayed along the way, Simmons explores with equal focus every complex, contradictory strand of Cohen\u2019s life\u2014from the halls of academia to the arenas of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2014and presents a deeply insightful portrait of both the artist and the man whose vision, spirit, depth and talent continue to move people like no one else.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Ecco", "language": "english", "pages": "576", "ISBN10": "0061994987", "ISBN13": "9780061994982", "file": "EPUB, 3.23 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1308936/63edcc"},

As a teenager, he found identity and purpose through both mountaineering and martial arts, which led the young adventurer to the foothills of the mighty Himalaya and a grandmaster's karate training camp in Japan. On returning home, he embarked upon the notoriously gruelling selection course for the British Special Forces to join 21 SAS - a journey that was to push him to the very limits of physical and mental endurance. Then, in a horrific free-fall parachuting accident in Africa, Bear broke his back in three places. It was touch and go whether he would ever walk again. However, only eighteen months later and defying doctors' expectations, Bear became one of the youngest ever climbers to scale Everest, aged only twenty-three.

Indeed, one of the twentieth century\u2019s most revered icons was a lively, prolific correspondent who developed in rich, nuanced dispatches the ideas that would influence generations of writers and intellectuals. This historic work\u2014never before published in America and featuring many previously unseen letters\u2014presents an account of Orwell\u2019s interior life as personal and absorbing as readers may ever see.  Over the course of a lifetime, Orwell corresponded with hundreds of people, including many distinguished political and artistic figures. Witty, personal, and profound, the letters tell the story of Orwell\u2019s passionate first love that ended in devastation and explains how young Eric Arthur Blair chose the pseudonym \"George Orwell.\" In missives to luminaries such as T. S. Eliot, Stephen Spender, Arthur Koestler, Cyril Connolly, and Henry Miller, he spells out his literary and philosophical beliefs. Readers will encounter Orwell\u2019s thoughts on matters both quotidian (poltergeists and the art of playing croquet) and historical\u2014including his illuminating descriptions of war-shattered Barcelona and pronouncements on bayonets and the immanent cruelty of chaining German prisoners. The letters also reveal the origins of his famous novels. To a fan he wrote, \"I think, and have thought ever since the war began\u2026that our cause is the better, but we have to keep on making it the better, which involves constant criticism.\" A paragraph before, he explained that the British intelligentsia in 1944 were \"perfectly ready for dictatorial methods, secret police, systematic falsification of history,\" prefiguring the themes of 1984. Entrusting the manuscript of Animal Farm to Leonard Moore, his literary agent, Orwell describes it as \"a sort of fairy story, really a fable with political meaning\u2026This book is murder from the Communist point of view.\" Hardly known outside a small circle of Orwell scholars, these rare letters include Orwell\u2019s message to Dwight Macdonald of 5 December 1946 explaining Animal Farm; his correspondence with his first translator, R. N. Raimbault (with English translations of the French originals); and the moving encomium written about Orwell by his BBC head of department after his service there. The volume concludes with a fearless account of the painful illness that took Orwell\u2019s life at age forty-seven. His last letter concerns his son and his estate and closes with the words, \"Beyond that I can\u2019t make plans at present.\" Meticulously edited and fully annotated by Peter Davison, the world\u2019s preeminent Orwell scholar, the volume presents Orwell \u201cin all his varieties\u201d and his relationships with those most close to him, especially his first wife, Eileen. Combined with rare photographs and hand-drawn illustrations, George Orwell: A Life in Letters offers \"everything a reader new to Orwell needs to know\u2026and a great deal that diehard fans will be enchanted to have\" (New Statesmen). 28 illustrations", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2013", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Liveright", "language": "english", "pages": "560", "ISBN10": "0871404621", "ISBN13": "9780871404626", "file": "EPUB, 4.48 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2216304/00dc79"},

This book is a record of those seminars, which took the form of informal discussions between Borges, Norman Thomas di Giovanni--his editor and translator, Frank MacShane--then head of the writing program at Columbia, and the students. Borges's prose, poetry, and translations are handled separately and the book is divided accordingly.The prose seminar is based on a line-by-line discussion of one of Borges's most distinctive stories, \"The End of the Duel.\" Borges explains how he wrote the story, his use of local knowledge, and his characteristic method of relating violent events in a precise and ironic way. This close analysis of his methods produces some illuminating observations on the role of the writer and the function of literature.The poetry section begins with some general remarks by Borges on the need for form and structure and moves into a revealing analysis of four of his poems. The final section, on translation, is an exciting discussion of how the art and culture of one country can be \"translated\" into the language of another.This book is a tribute to the brilliant craftsmanship of one of South America's--indeed, the world's--most distinguished writers and provides valuable insight into his inspiration and his method.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "1973", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Dutton", "language": "english", "pages": "173 / 177", "ISBN10": "0525069976", "ISBN13": "9780525069973", "file": "PDF, 1023 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2159905", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2159905/bf0f55"},

This kind of tribute is often of the Rochefoucauldian type; suggestive of the payoff made by vice to virtue, and also of the tricks played by an uneasy conscience.What [Orwell] illustrates, by his commitment to language as the partner of truth, is that \"views\" do not really count; that it matters not what you think, but how you think, and that politics are relatively unimportant, while principles have a way of enduring, as do the few irreducible individuals who maintain allegiance to them.Others on Hitchens:\"I have been asked whether I wish to nominate a successor, an inheritor, a dauphin or delphino.

But the son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett says that the only real inheritance handed down from his parents was a philosophy: Forge your own path in life. It is a creed that has allowed him to follow his own passions, establish his own identity, and reap his own successes. In Life Is What You Make It, Buffett expounds on the strong set of values given to him by his trusting and broadminded mother, his industrious and talented father, and the many life teachers he has met along the way.Today\u2019s society, Buffett posits, has begun to replace a work ethic, relishing what you do, with a wealth ethic, honoring the payoff instead of the process. We confuse privilege with material accumulation, character with external validation. Yet, by focusing more on substance and less on reward, we can open doors of opportunity and strive toward a greater sense of fulfillment. In clear and concise terms, Buffett reveals a great truth: Life is random, neither fair nor unfair. From there it becomes easy to recognize the equal dignity and value of every human life\u2014our circumstances may vary but our essences do not. We see that our journey in life rarely follows a straight line but is often met with false starts, crises, and blunders.

Michael Moss reveals how companies use salt, sugar, and fat to addict us and, more important, how we can fight back. \u00a0In the spring of 1999 the heads of the world\u2019s largest processed food companies\u2014from Coca-Cola to Nabisco\u2014gathered at Pillsbury headquarters in Minneapolis for a secret meeting. On the agenda: the emerging epidemic of obesity, and what to do about it. \u00a0 Increasingly, the salt-, sugar-, and fat-laden foods these companies produced were being linked to obesity, and a concerned Kraft executive took the stage to issue a warning: There would be a day of reckoning unless changes were made. This executive then launched into a damning PowerPoint presentation\u2014114 slides in all\u2014making the case that processed food companies could not afford to sit by, idle, as children grew sick and class-action lawyers lurked. To deny the problem, he said, is to court disaster. \u00a0 When he was done, the most powerful person in the room\u2014the CEO of General Mills\u2014stood up to speak, clearly annoyed. And by the time he sat down, the meeting was over. \u00a0 Since that day, with the industry in pursuit of its win-at-all-costs strategy, the situation has only grown more dire.\u00a0Every year, the average American eats thirty-three pounds of cheese (triple what we ate in 1970) and seventy pounds of sugar (about twenty-two teaspoons a day). We ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, and almost none of that comes from the shakers on our table. It comes from processed food. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that one in three adults, and one in five kids, is clinically obese. It\u2019s no wonder that twenty-six million Americans have diabetes, the processed food industry in the U.S. accounts for $1 trillion a year in sales, and the total economic cost of this health crisis is approaching $300 billion a year. \u00a0 In Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how we got here. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century\u2014including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestl\u00e9, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more\u2014Moss\u2019s explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research. \u00a0 Moss takes us inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the \u201cbliss point\u201d of sugary beverages or enhance the \u201cmouthfeel\u201d of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing campaigns designed\u2014in a technique adapted from tobacco companies\u2014to redirect concerns about the health risks of their products: Dial back on one ingredient, pump up the other two, and tout the new line as \u201cfat-free\u201d or \u201clow-salt.\u201d He talks to concerned executives who confess that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: The industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat. Just as millions of \u201cheavy users\u201d\u2014as the companies refer to their most ardent customers\u2014are addicted to this seductive trio, so too are the companies that peddle them.

Miller, CFA, Legg Mason Funds Management         About the Book:        When Benjamin Graham began working    on Wall Street in 1914, the center    of American finance resembled a lawless frontier.    The concept of regulatory laws was in its    infancy, the SEC wouldn\u2019t see the light of day    for 20 years, and many firms hid assets and    earnings from nosy outsiders.    And security analysts didn\u2019t exist as we    know them. They were called \u201cdiagnosticians,\u201d    and they didn\u2019t do much analyzing. These investors    prided themselves on going with the    \u201cfeel\u201d of the market, and most of them rarely    looked at a financial statement.    Appalled by the lack of research and quantification,    Benjamin Graham set out to change    all this\u2014and ended up creating the discipline    of modern security analysis.    A collection of rare writings by and interviews    with one of financial history\u2019s most brilliant    visionaries, Benjamin Graham, Building a    Profession presents Graham\u2019s evolution of ideas    on security analysis spanning five decades.    Articles include:        \u201cShould Security Analysts Have a    Professional Rating? The Affirmative Case\u201d        Financial Analysts Journal (1945)    \u201cToward a Science of Security Analysis\u201d    Financial Analysts Journal (1952)    \u201cInflated Treasuries and Deflated    Stockholders: Are Corporations    Milking Their Owners?\u201d Forbes (1932)    \u201cThe Future of Financial Analysis\u201d    Financial Analysts Journal (1963)    \u201cControlling versus Outside    Stockholders\u201d Virginia Law Weekly (1953)        These pages reveal the revolutionary ideas of a    man who didn\u2019t so much find his calling as he    created it from scratch\u2014and opened the door    for entire generations of investors.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2010", "edition": "1", "language": "english", "pages": "352 / 335", "ISBN10": "007163326X", "ISBN13": "9780071633260", "file": "PDF, 3.75 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/898734", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/898734/9cc8a9"},

His vision- capitalism for good; profit and progress. Naqvi was The Key Man to the global elite searching for impact investments - that would make money and do good - in what they called 'emerging markets'. He persuaded Western governments that he could help stabilise the Middle East after 9/11 by providing jobs and trade. When China rejuvenated the ancient Silk Road trading routes, Naqvi guided executives to business opportunities in cities they struggled to find on the map. He teamed up with Bill Gates to create a $1 billion dollar fund to improve healthcare in poor countries, managed huge sums for the American, British and French governments and sat on boards at the UN and Interpol.

What began with a shot over the bow ended in a shocking coup d'etat. In less than four months a group of eight retired executives orchestrated a stunning revolt within Morgan Stanley, the venerable and - until recently - most successful financial services firm on Wall Street. Now acclaimed journalist and historian Patricia Beard brings together the entire behind-the-scenes story in Blue Blood and Mutiny, a real-life business thriller exposing the tale that shook high finance. In March 2005 the business world woke up to an unprecedented full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal calling for the removal of Morgan Stanley's CEO. It was paid for by a cohort of eight former Morgan Stanley executives, including an ex-chairman and an ex-president, who soon would be dubbed the \"Eight Grumpy Old Men.\" Their target was CEO Philip Purcell, a midwesterner who had come to power following Morgan Stanley's 1997 merger with Dean Witter Discover, where Purcell had been chief executive.  In his eight years as CEO, Purcell had presided over a 50 percent decline in stock price since its peak in 2000 and a series of high-profile government and civil lawsuits that had tarnished the company's once-sterling reputation. Just a few months after the Journal ad, Purcell would retire under pressure, and former president John Mack, who had been pushed out by Purcell, was appointed CEO. The \"Eight Grumpy Old Men\" won the battle. The revolt of the Eight is about more than the stock price, or any bottom-line metrics - it signals a clash of cultures and a battle for the soul of American business. Since its founding, Morgan Stanley has been an elite enterprise guided by J. P. Morgan Jr.'s motto \"A First Class Business in a First Class Way.\" The House of Morgan stood for something larger than success with honor; its ethos was unique - some would say sacred - and the eight retired executives believed this ideal had been undermined during Purcell's reign.  Opening the long-closed doors of a bastion of Wall Street that has maintained the strictest privacy until now, Blue Blood and Mutiny weaves the history of Morgan Stanley with the inside story of the fight for dominance between two competing business cultures - one, the collegial meritocracy handed down from the days of J. P. Morgan, and the other, a cold, contemporary corporate model. Here is the season's must-read book for anyone who wants to understand the future of American business.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2007", "edition": "1St Edition", "language": "english", "pages": "432 / 433", "ISBN10": "0060881917", "ISBN13": "9780060881917", "file": "PDF, 2.32 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/934673", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/934673/ea84d3"},

The authors show the contribution that psychology can make to our understanding of the merger phenomena - how it affects organizational performance, and how it affects the managers and employees involved. Mergers, Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances is intended as a guide to successful organizational marriage. Great emphasis is placed on the issue of cultural compatibility as it concerns partner selection, integration practices and venture outcomes. The book also focuses on cross-national mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures. With the increasing economic activity within the European Union and between the unions of other countries, there is a need to know more about the corporate and national cultures in these strategic alliances. The authors have drawn upon an extensive body of research based on recent cases in a wide cross section of industries across Europe. The book is unique in showing the actual effect mergers and acquisitions have on people, and consequently on the performance of the 'new' organization. It will be particularly relevant for decision makers - those who are involved in planning and implementing a large organizational change, and those responsible for ensuring successful integration afterwards. It would also be extremely useful for postgraduate management students, personnel executives and management consultants.

Fraud and corruption remain a significant unmanaged source of risk for many organizations.

Included with the book is a fictionalized case study, The Tightrope, which maps out the anatomy of fraud and corruption from first suspicions to crisis and recovery.

Before that weekend, all national currencies were valued to the U.S. dollar, which was convertible to gold at a fixed rate. That system, established by the Bretton Woods Agreement at the end of World War II, was the foundation of the international monetary system that helped fuel the greatest expansion of middle-class prosperity the world has ever seen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In making his decision, Nixon shocked world leaders, bankers, investors, traders and everyone involved in global finance. Jeffrey E. Garten argues that many of the roots of America\u2019s dramatic retrenchment in world affairs began with that momentous event that was an admission that America could no longer afford to uphold the global monetary system. It opened the way for massive market instability and speculation that has plagued the world economy ever since, but at the same time it made possible the gigantic expansion of trade and investment across borders which created our modern era of once unimaginable progress.Based on extensive historical research and interviews with several participants at Camp David, and informed by Garten\u2019s own insights from positions in four presidential administrations and on Wall Street,\u00a0Three Days at Camp David\u00a0chronicles this critical turning point, analyzes its impact on the American economy and world markets, and explores its ramifications now and for the future.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2021", "publisher": "Harper", "language": "english", "pages": "363", "ISBN10": "006288767X", "file": "EPUB, 9.95 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16689527/471a9a"},

It was a juggernaut, the first retailer to sell $1 billion in goods, the owner of nearly sixteen thousand stores and dozens of factories and warehouses. But its explosive growth made it a mortal threat to hundreds of thousands of mom-and-pop grocery stores. Main Street fought back tooth and nail, enlisting the state and federal governments to stop price discounting, tax chain stores, and require manufacturers to sell to mom and pop at the same prices granted to giant retailers. In a remarkable court case, the federal government pressed criminalcharges against the Great A&P for selling food too cheaply\u2014and won. \u00a0The Great A&P and the Struggle for Small Business in America is the story of a stunningly successful company that forever changed how Americans shop and what Americans eat. It is a brilliant business history, the story of how George and John Hartford took over their father\u2019s business and reshaped it again and again, turning it into a vertically integrated behemoth that paved the way for every big-box retailer to come. George demanded a rock-solid balance sheet; John was the marketer-entrepreneur who led A&P through seven decades of rapid changes. Together, they built the modern consumer economy by turning the archaic retail industry into a highly efficient system for distributing food at low cost.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Hill and Wang", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0809095432", "ISBN13": "9781429969024", "file": "EPUB, 801 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

Those two Steves, one now a billionaire and still at the head of Apple, not only succeeded with that product, but they also broke ground in the business world in ways few thought possible: They proved you could not only have fun at work, but pursuing a capitalist dream could be hip. How did Apple do it? How did it go from making computers that made a difference but not much of a dent in the overall market to creating a device (the iPod) and a music service (iTunes) that has changed the way we buy and experience music? And how did the Macintosh and its successors capture the hearts and minds of computer users so deeply that being a Mac person makes you a member of a special club? That's what this book is all about.As author Jason D. O'Grady shows, Apple is a rare company\u2014one that is not afraid to think about a future that does not exist and turn it into reality. Critics have written Apple off time and again, yet it rises from the ashes to astound the critics and delight its customers. That's not luck or happenstance\u2014it's vision, dedication, and persistence.

Branded with an unflattering nickname, these high yield securities were tarnished in the public eye by waves of negative publicity.  Critics cast the financiers and entrepreneurs who pioneered their use as symbols of a decade of greed and financial excess. By the end of the 1980s, the heyday of junk bonds had seemingly come to a close with the conviction of junk bond pioneer Michael Milken and the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the brokerage that dominated the high yield market. But the controversy surrounding junk bonds continues.     Now, in Junk Bonds, business professor Glenn Yago turns the tables on conventional wisdom about this new financial technology.  He offers the first systematic examination of the facts about high yield securities.  His analysis provides hard evidence that demystifies junk bonds and explodes many of the popular myths that surround them.     Junk Bonds sheds light on the role of high yield financing in what Yago calls the democratization of capital. Before the advent of junk bonds, only companies with an \"investment grade\" rating--five percent of the 23,000 American companies with sales over $35 million--had access to long term capital.  In effect, the author argues, 95 percent of American companies were denied the means to finance growth and business development.  Yago shows how junk bonds changed all that, breathing life into thousands of American companies that had been shunned by the capital markets.  His research demonstrates that these \"junk\" companies outperformed many Fortune 500 firms in job creation, product development, sales, and business innovation.     The real contribution of junk bonds, according to Yago, was to improve the productivity and competitiveness of American business by restructuring companies in the wake of the corporate conglomerations of the 1960s and 1970s.  His findings show that divestitures by companies financed with high yield bonds were not necessarily destructive.  Many sold-off units flourished as independent enterprises at a time when numerous \"investment grade\" companies stagnated or closed plants or fired workers.  This restructuring of corporate America has enabled businesses to compete in a changing international environment, benefiting managers, workers, stockholders, and investors alike.     Junk Bonds provides readers with a scholarly analysis that shears away the hype and hysteria that often accompany rapid change. And at a time when Wall Street is under greater scrutiny than at any time since the Depression, this provocative study provides a timely and thoughtful contribution to the debate surrounding junk bonds.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "1990", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "264", "ISBN10": "019506111X", "ISBN13": "9780195061116", "file": "PDF, 14.39 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1107894", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1107894/7348cb"},

Hayagreeva Rao tells a different story, one that will change the way you think about markets forever. He explains how \"market rebels\"--activists who defy authority and convention--are the real force behind the success or failure of radical innovations. Rao shows how automobile enthusiasts were the ones who established the new automobile industry by staging highly publicized reliability races and lobbying governments to enact licensing laws. Ford exploited the popularity of the car by using new mass-production technologies. Rao argues that market rebels also establish new niches and new cultural styles. If it were not for craft brewers who crusaded against \"industrial beer\" and proliferated brewpubs, there would be no specialty beers in America. But for nouvelle cuisine activists who broke the stranglehold of Escoffier's classical cuisine in France, there would have been little hybridization and experimentation in modern cooking. Market rebels also thwart radical innovation. Rao demonstrates how consumer activists have faced down chain stores and big box retailers, and how anti-biotechnology activists in Germany penetrated pharmaceutical firms and delayed the commercialization of patents. Read Market Rebels to learn how activists succeed when they construct \"hot causes\" that arouse intense emotions, and exploit \"cool mobilization\"--unconventional techniques that engage audiences in collective action. You will realize how the hands that move markets are the joined hands of market rebels.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2008", "language": "english", "pages": "222", "ISBN10": "0691134561", "ISBN13": "9780691134567", "file": "PDF, 831 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/923000", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/923000/7b118b"},

Carlyle's investments include everything from defense contractors to telecommunications and aerospace companies. But there is more to this company than meets the eye. Carlyle's executives include heavyweights from the worlds of business and politics, such as former secretary of defense and CIA deputy director Frank Carlucci, former secretary of state James Baker III, former President George Bush, former UK Prime Minister John Major, and former chairman of the SEC Arthur Levitt. Osama Bin Laden's estranged family was personally invested in the group until recently. In The Iron Triangle, journalist Dan Briody examines a company at the nexus of big business, government, and defense that, according to some sources, epitomizes corporate cronyism, conflicts of interest, and war profiteering. This fascinating examination leads readers into a w orld that few can imagine-full of clandestine meetings, quid pro quo deals, bitter ironies, and pettyjealousies. And the cast of characters includes some of the most powerful men in the world. Strap in, because this ride could get a little bumpy.Dan Briody (New York, NY) is an award-winning business journalist whose Red Herring article \"Carlyle's Way\" broke the story on the inner workings of the Carlyle Group. Briody has appeared on numerous radio and television programs covering the Carlyle Group and has become a primary source for other journalists covering this story.

In this land where twenty-five years ago most of the population had never tasted chocolate, five icons of Western business are now slugging it out in a battle royal to see which will become the Emperor of Chocolate in China. Chocolate Fortunes offers the first inside look at the battle for China's newfound chocolate addiction. The book devotes individual chapters to each of the five major players Hershey, Nestle, Cadbury, Mars, and Ferrero and the trials they face as they attempt to dominate their market in an enigmatic and still-developing economy. More broadly, Chocolate Fortunes examines the unique opportunities and challenges inherent in the Chinese business universe.

By its tenth anniversary, Atari had become a $2-billion-a-year empire--making it the fastest-growing company in the history of American business. Today, however, the company that once controlled over 80 percent of the video-game market has lost its hold over the estimated 17 million American households with video games to its numerous competitors, and scandal has rocked Wall Street. In Zap! Scott Cohen profiles Atari from its humble beginnings in Silicon Valley, California, through its multi-nillion-dollar sale to Warner Communications, to its headline-making present. He has interviewed many former and present employees (both designers and of creative imagination and innovation that enabled Atari to dominate the market for so long and identifies those which, in the end, will determine whether Atari will survive in a highly competitive, growing market.

Here, Mauro Guill?n and Adrian Tschoegl tackle the question of how this once-sleepy, family-run provincial bank in a developing economy transformed itself into a financial-services group with more than sixty-six million customers on three continents. Founded 150 years ago in the Spanish port city of the same name, Santander is the only large bank in the world where three successive generations of one family have led top management and the board of directors. But Santander is fully modern. Drawing on rich data and in-depth interviews with family members and managers, Guill?n and Tschoegl reveal how strategic decisions by the family and complex political, social, technological, and economic forces drove Santander's unprecedented rise to global prominence. The authors place the bank in this competitive milieu, comparing it with its rivals in Europe and America, and showing how Santander, faced with growing competition in Spain and Europe, sought growth opportunities in Latin America and elsewhere. They also address the complexities of managerial succession and family leadership, and weigh the implications of Santander's stellar rise for the consolidation of European banking. Building a Global Bank tells the fascinating story behind this powerful corporation's remarkable transformation--and of the family behind it.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Business & Finance", "year": "2008", "language": "english", "pages": "280 / 279", "ISBN10": "0691131252", "ISBN13": "9780691131252", "file": "PDF, 799 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/856037", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/856037/a119ee"},

Orphaned at a young age and dependent on the charity of unsympathetic relatives, he became the archetypal teenage rebel. Refusing to enter the Church, he went instead to Revolutionary France, where he fathered an illegitimate daughter and became a committed Republican. His poetry was as revolutionary as his politics, challenging convention in form, style, and subject, and earning him the universal derision and contempt of critics. Only the unfailing encouragement of a tightly knit group of supporters, his family, and, above all, Coleridge kept him true to his poetic vocation. In the half-century that followed his reputation was transformed. His advocacy of the importance of imagination and feeling touched a chord in an increasingly industrial, mechanistic age, and his influence was profoundly and widely felt in every sphere of life. In the last decade of his life, Rydal Mount, his home for thirty-seven years, became a place of pilgrimage, not just for the great and powerful in Church and state, but also, more touchingly, for the hundreds of ordinary people who came to pay their respects to his genius. In what is, astonishingly, the first biography of Wordsworth to treat the latter part of his life as fully as the first, Juliet Barker balances meticulous research with a readable style, and scrupulous objectivity with an understanding of her subject. She reveals not only the public figure who was courted and reviled in equal measure but also the complex, elusive, private man behind that image. Drawing on unpublished sources, she vividly re-creates the intimacy of Wordsworth's domestic circle, showing the love, laughter, loyalty, and tragedies that bound them together. Far from being the remote, cold, solitary figure of legend, Wordsworth emerges from his biography as a passionate, vibrant man who lived for his family, his poetry, and his beloved Lakeland. His legacy, as a poet and as the spiritual founder of the conservation movement, remains with us today.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2005", "language": "english", "pages": "576 / 584", "ISBN10": "0060787368", "ISBN13": "9780061120541", "file": "PDF, 5.15 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/956682", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/956682/fd257d"},

Mann", "M. Evans", "Stephen Fry"], "rating": "0", "description": "Amazon.com Review  **Product Description**   In the 60s, Elizabeth Taylor's affair with the married Richard Burton knocked John Glenn's orbit of the moon off front pages nationwide. Yet, despite all the gossip, the larger-than-life personality and influence of this very human woman has never been captured. William Mann, praised by Gore Vidal, Patricia Bosworth, and Gerald Clarke for *Kate*, uses untapped sources and conversations to show how she ignited the sexual revolution with her on-and off-screen passions, helped kick down the studio system by taking control of her own career, and practically invented the big business of celebrity star-making. With unputdownable storytelling he tells the full truth without losing Taylor's magic, daring, or wit.   Readers will feel they are sitting next to Taylor as she rises at MGM, survives a marriage engineered for publicity, feuds with Hedda Hopper and Mr. Mayer, wins Oscars, endures tragedy, juggles Eddie Fisher, Richard Burton and her country's conservative values. But it is the private Elizabeth that will surprise--a woman of heart and loyalty, who defends underdogs, a savvy professional whose anger at the studio's treatment of her led to a lifelong battle against that very system. All the Elizabeth's are here, finally reconciled and seen against the exciting years of her greatest spirit, beauty, and influence. Swathed in mink, staring us down with her lavender eyes, disposing of husbands but keeping the diamonds, here is Elizabeth Taylor as she was meant to be, leading her epic life on her own terms, playing the game of supreme stardom at which she remains, to this day, unmatched.     * * *  **A Q&A with William J. Mann, Author of *How to Be a Movie Star***     **Q:** There have been more books on Elizabeth Taylor than just about any other star in Hollywood. Why do we need another one?  **A:** As entertaining as some of those books have been, none has really explored how she did it--how she created the culture of celebrity that we have today. Elizabeth Taylor really invented the modern enterprise of fame. Everyone from Madonna to Britney to Miley Cyrus is taking a page from her book.  **Q:** How were you able to chart this phenomenon?  **A:** It's helpful to understand how Hollywood works. Publicists and press agents would like us to think everything is spontaneous and real. Hey, those two stars making a movie together just happened to fall in love on the set! That it also provides a publicity bonanza is completely separate. There was no coordination, no manipulation. At least that's what they'd like us to think.  **Q:** Was that true for Taylor then? Were her legendary romances all manufactured for how they'd play in the press?  **A:** Not at all. Elizabeth was and is a passionate, independent woman. She always believed in what she was doing. For example, I chronicle the frantic press coverage and feverish public interest in her first marriage, when she was just 18, to Nicky Hilton--who, incidentally, was Paris Hilton's granduncle. As a romantic teenager, Elizabeth was gung-ho about making the marriage work--no matter that MGM was stage-managing the whole thing. They pushed this innocent girl into a marriage that turned out to be abusive and traumatic for her all so they could publicize a film, *Father of the Bride*, which was timed to come out at the same time. So Elizabeth was a movie bride at the same time as she was a real-life bride, but real life had far more dire consequences.  **Q:** So that must have been an early lesson for her in star-making, albeit a very difficult one.  **A:** Certainly she learned early on how the game was played. But what's wonderful about Elizabeth is that she never became jaded or cynical or dishonest. In fact, I think she's one of the most authentic stars ever to come out of Hollywood. She never lied to the public the way other stars did. But previous biographies have limited their approach to simply chronicling her passionate heart--without taking into account how these romances and marriages and scandals actually benefited her career. She really did fall in love with Eddie Fisher and Richard Burton while they were married to other women. But that didn't mean she and those around her didn't understand just how advantageous the headlines could be for Elizabeth.  **Q:** But it's always been said that the scandals with Fisher and Burton threatened to end her career, that the studios worried the public would turn its back on such a \"scarlet woman.\"  **A:** That's just the spin. That's what they had to say. It was the old conventional wisdom. But Elizabeth is actually a very important figure in terms of celebrity culture. More than anyone else, she bridges the divide between Old Hollywood and New Hollywood. Old Hollywood, represented by the studios and conservative columnists like Hedda Hopper, expected the scandals to destroy Elizabeth. Indeed, they did their best to make sure she was penalized. But Elizabeth, who was being advised by a new breed of canny publicists and agents, knew that in this emerging Hollywood, there really was no such thing anymore as bad publicity.  **Q:** She was pretty damn famous, wasn't she? Far more famous than anything we have today, like Britney and Paris and the rest?  **A:** Absolutely. Especially in the 1950s and 1960s, when everything she did made headlines. Husbands, romances, movies, health crises, diamonds. John Glenn was making his historic orbit of the Earth but many newspapers still went with the Taylor-Burton scandal in Rome as their top story.  **Q:** And this then became the norm for celebrity culture? It changed the concept of \"news.\"  **A:** Exactly. In the past, serious publications wouldn't lower themselves to cover movie stars. But suddenly there were editorials about Elizabeth Taylor all across the country. She was an enormous cultural influence. She showed that one could still be famous outside of the old studio structure by engaging her own team of personal managers and press agents. As a child and teenaged star, she learned all those valuable lessons at MGM. Then she took what she had learned and made it work for her on her own. And turned out to be an even bigger star outside the studio than she was before.  **Q:** Was she a better actress or a better movie star?  **A:** I think Elizabeth would acknowledge that she excelled more often as \"movie star\" than she did as \"actress.\" But she could really be damn good at times. Here's something that sets her apart from these modern-day stars who, whether they know it or not, are following her playbook. Elizabeth understood that fame is an exchange with the public. For every headline there needed to be a good movie. You had to give something back. She never simply coasted on her fame. Instead, she turned in some truly outstanding performances in *A Place in the Sun*, *Giant*, *Cat on a Hot Tin Roof*, and *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf*--there are others, but those are her four best, in my opinion.  **Q:** She's known for so many health crises. There was the time she almost died in London and the whole world watched and waited for news. How true was all that?  **A:** Everything's true with Elizabeth. Whether or not she was as critical as she and those around her claimed, there's no doubting the sincerity of the experience for her. But even still, that shouldn't discount just how brilliant she and her publicists were in using that experience to her advantage. A year before, in the wake of the Fisher scandal, she had been tarred as Hollywood's home-wrecker. Now she was hailed as Lazarus back from the grave. In the book, I document the fascinating process of how this particular episode played out in the press and then climaxed with her winning her first Academy Award. It's a perfect illustration of the book's title:*How to Be a Movie Star*.  **Q:** So you're saying that Elizabeth Taylor was far more shrewd than we've been led to believe.  **A:** Absolutely. Far, far more shrewd. You know, \"smart\" has never been the first word that comes to mind when we think of Elizabeth Taylor. Glamorous, beautiful, alluring, sure. But in fact she was perhaps the smartest of all the old stars in knowing how to both maintain her fame and preserve a real private life as well. She didn't sacrifice personal happiness on the altar of fame, as so many others did. She had both.  **Q:** Would modern-day Hollywood exist without Elizabeth Taylor?  **A:** Well, it sure would look a heck of lot different. Elizabeth was the first female star to demand a million dollars a picture and a percent of the grosses. The deals she struck in the early 1960s really changed the financial structure of Hollywood. When she heard not long ago that Julia Roberts was getting something like twenty million a picture, she just smiled and said, \"I started it.\" I think it's a perfect irony that a woman who so loathed the old studio system helped create the business model that replaced it.  **Q:** What else do you reveal about Elizabeth that we never knew before?  **A:** There's considerable new information on her mother, a fascinating woman in her own right, as well about as Mike Todd, Elizabeth's third husband who really set her on the road to the kind of extraordinary fame she eventually enjoyed. There are some important re-considerations on how she met and married Todd, and the same with Eddie Fisher, and then Richard Burton. It's so important to understand these people's lives in context with everyone else that was happening around them, and I attempt to do that here with Elizabeth, to not have her life read like pages from some old *Photoplay* magazine.  **Q:** But to do that, you need fresh sources. Did you find new sources writing the book?  **A:** I was fortunate to get many people close to Elizabeth to speak with me, both on and off the record. I was also able to get my hands on important documents that had never been used before or severely under-utilized. A journal kept by the producer of *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf* allowed me to get an inside, up-close view of the making of that picture. George Stevens' personal papers recreated the intimate day-to-day production of *Giant* and *A Place in the Sun*. Then there were Hedda Hopper's private letters and Mike Todd's FBI files and records from the MGM legal department and depositions Elizabeth gave in the lawsuit Fox brought against her. You really have dig out this new stuff or else you end up relying on old newspaper clippings, which are recycled by every biographer.     * * *  **Photographs from *How to Be a Movie Star: Elizabeth Taylor in Hollywood***   **(Click on Images to Enlarge)**     1939: Elizabeth with her mother Sara, and brother Howard1941: Elizabeth's first publicity photo, Universal Studios  1945: Elizabeth posing with Roddy McDowallEarly 1950s: Publicity photo (photo not included in the book)  * * *   From Publishers Weekly  In his proficient and titillating biography of one of the last greats to emerge from the Hollywood studio system, Mann (*Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn*) spotlights Taylor's feverish, sensuous years during the high '50s and '60s, when she set her own standards of fame, both moral and professional. Tinged by scandal as well as touched by greatness as an actress, Taylor was the first female movie star to earn a million dollars for a movie plus a share of the profits (*Cleopatra* in 1963). Mann relishes depicting Taylor's larger-than-life appetites, whether for men, jewels or food, and marvels at her ability to arouse and sidestep scandal, as well as to demonstrate continually a singular devotion to her acting craft, as captured in *A Place in the Sun* and *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* Taylor managed not only to play along with the old Hollywood system perfectly\u2014for example, allowing MGM to orchestrate her first marriage to Nicky Hilton in 1950 in order to pump publicity for her film *Father of the Bride*\u2014but to flout it outrageously, e.g., by becoming the ultimate home wrecker in Eddie Fisher's marriage, and all to her advantage. Mann employs an authoritative voice, promising intimacies but still remaining respectful of his subject, and concentrates on Taylor's skillful use of marriages and illness to get what she wanted. By refusing to apologize for her flagrant adulterous affair with Richard Burton, Taylor possibly spurred the sexual revolution of the 1960s, Mann suggests.

Now License to Pawn takes readers behind the scenes of the hit History show Pawn Stars and shares the fascinating life story of its star, Rick Harrison, and the equally intriguing story behind the shop, the customers, and the items for sale. Rick hasn't had it easy. He was a math whiz at an early age, but developed a similarly uncanny ability to find ever-deepening trouble that nearly ruined his life. With the birth of his son, he sobered up, reconnected with his dad, and they started their booming business together. License to Pawn also offers an entertaining walk through the pawn shop's history. It's a captivating look into how the Gold & Silver works, with incredible stories about the crazy customers and the one-of-a-kind items that the shop sells. Rick isn't only a businessman; he's also a historian and keen observer of human nature. For instance, did you know that pimps wear lots of jewelry for a reason? It's because if they're arrested, jewelry doesn't get confiscated like cash does, and ready money will be available for bail. Or that WWII bomber jackets and Zippo lighters can sell for a freakishly high price in Japan? Have you ever heard that the makers of Ormolu clocks, which Rick sells for as much as $15,000 apiece, frequently died before forty thanks to the mercury in the paint? Rick also reveals the items he loves so much he'll never sell. The shop has three Olympic bronze medals, a Patriots Super Bowl ring, a Samurai sword from 1490, and an original Iwo Jima battle plan. Each object has an incredible story behind it, of course. Rick shares them all, and so much more--there's an irresistible treasure trove of history behind both the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop and the life of Rick Harrison.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2011", "edition": "First Printing", "publisher": "Hyperion", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "1401324304", "ISBN13": "9781401324308", "file": "EPUB, 1015 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1181139/e4ef61"},

She personified the ideal homemaker on television. In the movies she was the archetypal sweetheart and wife. The only time she played a fallen woman, in From Here to Eternity, she won an Academy Award. Her work has lived on in saturation reruns of The Donna Reed Show and the holiday classic It's a Wonderful Life.     But who was Donna Reed? Perhaps no celebrity of her symbolic importance is so little known. Moving from the backroads of Iowa to the mansions of Bel Air, Jay Fultz goes in search of the woman behind the image.     In Search of Donna Reed reveals a woman whose intelligence and force of character often put her at odds with the roles she portrayed both on and off screen. Reed, always angered by the treatment of women in Hollywood, turned political activist in middle age, confronting for the first time the arrogance of power. She was, said writer Barbara Avedon, a feminist before there was a feminist vocabulary. But she eludes any label.    This first biography of Donna Reed also contains the first extended discussion of her television show. The personal richness that Reed brought to her television role has been filtered out in the caricature perpetuated by pop critics. In the media \"Donna Reed\" is Donna Stone distorted as a female-manqu? who wears pearls and high heels around the house. But Donna Reed's long hold on viewers depends on irreducible qualities that have nothing to do with this fixed image, as Fultz suggests.    He follows her development from Iowa farm girl to apprentice in Hollywood to mature juggler of the demands of family and career to antiwar activist. Drawing on Reed's letters and on interviews, Fultz looks for what was real in a very private person without discarding what is romantic in any pursuit of a public one. He shows why the rich and principled life of Donna Reed matters in this more cynical time.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "1998", "publisher": "University of Iowa Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0877456259", "ISBN13": "9781587290763", "file": "EPUB, 1.11 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1076866/d697f3"},

Syfers"], "rating": "0", "description": "Art Tatum defined the limits of the possible in jazz piano. Gunther Schuller called Tatum's playing \"a marvel of perfection.... His deep-in-the-keys full piano sonority, the tone and touch control in pyrotechnical passages...are miracles of performance.\" Whitney Balliett wrote \"no pianist has ever hit notes more beautifully. Each one--no matter how fast the tempo--was light and complete and resonant, like the letters on a finely printed page.\" His famous runs have been compared to the arc left against the night sky by a Fourth-of-July sparkler. And to have heard him play, one musician said, \"was as awe-inspiring as to have seen the Grand Canyon or Halley's Comet.\" Now, in Too Marvelous For Words, James Lester provides the first full-length biography of the greatest virtuoso performer in the history of jazz. Before this volume, little was known about Tatum, even among jazz afficionados. What were his origins, who taught him and who provided early pianistic influences, how did he break into the jazz field, what role did he play in the development of other jazz players, and what was he like when he wasn't playing? To answer these questions, Lester has conducted almost a hundred interviews for this book, with surviving family, childhood friends, schoolteachers, and the famous jazz musicians who played with him or knew him. Lester creates a memorable portrait of this unique musician and of the vibrant jazz world of the 1930s and 1940s, capturing the complexity and vitality of this remarkable performer. Tatum, who was virtually blind, suffering between 70% and 90% visual impairment, emerges as cheerful, fun-loving, energetic and out-going, with none of the demonic self-destructiveness that seemed to haunt such jazz greats as Charlie Parker or Billie Holiday. He often joked about his blindness, but did not like it mentioned as a handicap and preferred to pre-plan his entrance to the piano in a club, rather than have someone lead him there. He was simply inexhaustible and had a life-long habit of staying up all night after a gig, usually seeking an after-hours club in which to listen and play until daybreak. Lester also reveals that Tatum was generous with younger players, but his extraordinary technical brilliance often devastated them. No less a talent than Oscar Peterson remembers that after first hearing Tatum, \"I gave up the piano for two solid months, and I had crying fits at night.\" And Les Paul remarked that after hearing Tatum for the first time, he quit piano completely and began playing guitar. Perhaps most important, Lester provides a thorough, knowledgeable discussion of Tatum's music, from his early influences, such as stride pianist Fats Waller, to his mature style in which Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, Waller, and Earl Hines all became grist for his harmonic mill. From unexceptional origins in Toledo, Ohio, Art Tatum evolved into a world-class musician whose importance in jazz is comparable to Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker and whose command of the piano captured the admiration of Horowitz and Paderewski.

Like Betty Friedan and William H. Whyte, Jr., Packard (1914- ) is a journalist who played an influential role as the largely complacent 1950s gave way to the tumultuous 1960s. He is also one of the first social critics to foster and to benefit from the newly energized social and political consciousness of this period. Raised on a Pennsylvania farm, shaped by the New Deal at home and the rise of fascism abroad, and trained as a journalist, Packard turned to writing nonfiction books when he faced unemployment in 1956. In addition to his three best-known early works, his later books explore many of the forces shaping America, including invasion of privacy, changing sexual mores, the uprooting of families, and the rise of the ultra rich in the Reagan era. The titles of Packard's most famous works have become a part of our everyday vocabulary. Based in part on interviews with Packard, Daniel Horowitz's intellectual biography focuses on the period during which Packard wrote his major works of social criticism. Horowitz also traces the influence of the writer's early family life and education on his thought. Packard's life illuminates the dilemmas of a freelance social critic without inherited wealth or academic affiliation: the tension between making a living and sustaining independence; the problems posed by a dramatically fluctuating royalty income; and the impact of changing relationships with audience,publishers, intellectuals, academics, and new media such as television and the New Journalism. Packard's career also expands our understanding of how one era helped create the next, underscoring how the adversarial 1960s drew on the mass culture of the previous decade.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "1994", "publisher": "UNC Press Books", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0807821411", "ISBN13": "9780807821411", "file": "EPUB, 1.38 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1115819/87070f"},

VanderKam", "Michael Chesbro"], "rating": "0", "description": "The Extraordinary Story of a Man, a Legend and a MarriageWhen she was eighteen years old, a girl named Cynthia Powell met a boy named John Lennon and they fell in love. Their ten-year relationship coincided with the start of the Beatles phenomenon\u2014from Liverpool\u2019s dockside clubs to the dizzying worldwide fame that followed. And Cynthia Lennon, John\u2019s first wife, was an integral part of the swirl of events that are now an indelible part of the history of rock and roll. In John, Cynthia recalls those times with the loving honesty of an insider, offering new and fascinating insights into the life of John Lennon and the early days of the Beatles. And with the perspective only years can provide she also tells the compelling story of her marriage to a man who was to become a music legend, a cultural hero and a defining figure of the twentieth century.Cynthia has seldom talked in any detail about her marriage and the painful events that followed John\u2019s tragic assassination in 1980. Now she candidly reveals the good and the bad, the loving and the cruel sides of John. She tells of the breakdown of their marriage and the beginning of his relationship with Yoko Ono in more detail than has ever been disclosed before and documents the difficulties estrangement from John\u2014and his subsequent death\u2014brought for herself and their son, Julian.In John, Cynthia Lennon has created a vivid portrait of the 1960s, the Beatles and the man she never stopped loving. The time has come when I feel ready to tell the truth about John and me, our years together and the years since his death. There is so much that I have never said, so many incidents I have never spoken of and so many feelings I have never expressed: great love on one hand; pain, torment and humiliation on the other. Only I know what really happened between us, why we stayed together, why we parted and the price I have paid for being John\u2019s wife.I want to tell the real story of the real John\u2014the infuriating, lovable, sometimes cruel, funny, talented and needy man who made such an impact on the world. \u2014From the Introduction", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2005", "edition": "First Edition", "language": "english", "pages": "320 / 403", "ISBN10": "030733855X", "ISBN13": "9780307338556", "file": "PDF, 1.01 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/921629", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/921629/9dfaf7"},

But at what cost? From the age of ten, when she made her acting debut on Good Times, Janet was told by Hollywood that she needed to slim down. Her well-meaning brothers, especially fun-loving Michael, teased her relentlessly until she began to believe that who she was wasn\u2019t good enough. It was an idea that no amount of critical acclaim in television and film or, later, international platinum success in music could change. Janet turned to food for comfort and escape. She developed a self-destructive pattern familiar to so many of us: fear and uncertainty led to bad feelings about herself and ultimately depression. The depression led to overeating. And her yo-yoing weight was painfully obvious in the bright lights of the entertainment world. It has taken Janet most of her adult life to come to terms with who she is. But she has finally broken free of the attitudes that brought her down and has embraced realistic goals that help her eat better, exercise better, feel better, and ultimately be better. This book is about meeting those challenges that face all of us. With candor and courage, Janet shares her painful journey to loving herself. She addresses the crazy rumors that have swirled around her for most of her life, shines an intimate light on her family, and pulls us behind the velvet rope into her unforgettable career. She also shares lessons she has learned through contact with friends and fans and reveals the fitness secrets she has learned from her trainer. Finally, her nutritionist, David Allen, unveils the wholesome, delicious recipes and lifestyle-changing tips that helped Janet get in shape\u2014mind and spirit, heart and soul. True You is a call to tune in to your own fundamental wisdom, to let go of the ugly comparisons, and to understand that who you are, the true you, is more than enough. ***\u201cI\u2019m loved, I\u2019m valued, and I\u2019m capable of achieving balance in my life. I can learn to eat well. I can exercise. I can express gratitude for the simple act of being able to breathe in and breathe out. I can move away from darkness and depression to light and hope. I can be happy with who I am, not what I should be, or what I might have been, or what someone tells me I must be. I am me, the true me; you are you, the true you\u2014and that\u2019s good.

Patti Smith would evolve as a poet and performer, and Robert Mapplethorpe would direct his highly provocative style toward photography. Bound in innocence and enthusiasm, they traversed the city from Coney Island to Forty-second Street, and eventually to the celebrated round table of Max's Kansas City, where the Andy Warhol contingent held court. In 1969, the pair set up camp at the Hotel Chelsea and soon entered a community of the famous and infamous\u2014the influential artists of the day and the colorful fringe. It was a time of heightened awareness, when the worlds of poetry, rock and roll, art, and sexual politics were colliding and exploding. In this milieu, two kids made a pact to take care of each other. Scrappy, romantic, committed to create, and fueled by their mutual dreams and drives, they would prod and provide for one another during the hungry years.   Just Kids begins as a love story and ends as an elegy. It serves as a salute to New York City during the late sixties and seventies and to its rich and poor, its hustlers and hellions.

Bars, recording studios, offshore banks -- all were money-laundering vehicles serving the core business: dope dealing. At the height of his career he was smuggling consignments of up to thirty tons of marijuana and had contact with organizations as diverse as MI6, the CIA, the IRA, and the Mafia. Following a worldwide operation by the DEA, he was busted and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison at Terre Haute Penitentiary, Indiana. He was released in April 1995 after serving seven years of his sentence. With pages of photographs, and told with humor, charm, and candor, Mr Nice is his own extraordinary story.

Paul Mooney tells the truth. And for more than forty years -- whether writing for Richard Pryor and *Saturday Night Live*, creating *In Living Color's* Homey D. Clown and *Chappelle's Show's* Negrodamus, or performing stand-up to sold-out crowds around the country -- he's been provocative, incisive, and always absolutely hilarious. *Black Is the New White* is an unapologetically candid memoir from a talent whose influence has ranged far wider than his fame -- mostly by his own design. As head writer for *The Richard Pryor Show*, he helped tear down racial barriers and change the course of comedy. He helped Robin Williams and Sandra Bernhard break into show business. He paved the way for superstars like Eddie Murphy. And at every turn he's shunned the easy set-up and punch line in favor of comedy that's indisputably real and raw, reflecting the reality of race issues in America even when it's generated outrage. While other stars soared only to crash and burn, Paul Mooney has stayed chiefly behind the scenes, and he's got a lifetime of stories to show for it. Few have witnessed as much comedy history as Mooney; even fewer could recount it with such riotous honesty and depth of insight. He reveals the truth about his celebrated partnership with the brilliant, self-destructive Richard Pryor, from their first meeting to the very last joke, and reflects on some of his most notorious moments, including organizing a performers' strike on the iconic Comedy Store and publicly giving up the n-word in his act after Michael Richards's onstage outbursts. Decades ago, Paul Mooney set out not just to make audiences laugh but to make them think. *Black Is the New White* is the blisteringly funny, no-holds-barred story of how he continues to succeed wildly at both.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2009", "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9781416587958", "file": "MOBI , 1.23 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1231936/f9d5e9"},

Every word and gesture made headlines and garnered controversy. Her serious gifts as an actor were sometimes eclipsed by her notoriety\u2014and by the way the camera fell helplessly in love with her.Beyond the headlines\u2014and the too-familiar stories of heartbreak and desolation\u2014was a woman far more curious, searching, witty, and hopeful than the one the world got to know.

Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool.Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty. Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details. My Horizontal Life is one guilty pleasure you won't be ashamed to talk about in the morning.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2005", "edition": "Later Printing", "publisher": "Bloomsbury Publishing USA", "language": "english", "pages": "213", "ISBN10": "1582346186", "ISBN13": "9781582346182", "file": "EPUB, 201 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/948624/667645"},

From Korn's legendary bassist comes a no-holds-barred look at the extreme highs and drug-and-booze-fueled lows of the biggest heavy metal band of our era    Music was in his bones. From the time he was an infant, Fieldy watched his dad's band perform, and soon enough he found his own calling: the bass. After high school, with a guitar and little else, he left his small California town for the music scene in L.A. Before long, Fieldy, Brian \"Head\" Welch, James \"Munky\" Shaffer, drummer David Silveria, and Jonathan Davis would gel together and form a band with a completely new sound\u2014Korn.   What happened next was something Fieldy had always dreamed of but was totally unprepared for: Korn exploded, skyrocketing to the top of the charts and fronting the nu metal phenomenon. Fieldy was thrust into the fast-paced, hard-rocking spotlight. Korn began to tour incessantly, creating intense live shows fueled by wild offstage antics. Fieldy became a rock star, and he acted like one, notorious not only for his one-of-a-kind bass lines, but also for his hard-partying, womanizing, bad-boy ways. The more drugs he took, the more booze he drank, the worse he became: He was unfaithful, abusive, mean, and sometimes violent.   By all appearances, Fieldy had the life. But he was on the dark path of excess, alienating friends, families, and loved ones, nearly destroying himself and the band. It took an unexpected tragedy to straighten him out: the death of his father, a born-again Christian, to a mysterious illness. Following his father's dying wish, Fieldy found God. Filled with the spirit of his new faith, Fieldy quit drugs and drinking cold turkey, and found the best part of himself.   With never-before-seen photos, and never-before-heard stories, Got the Life is raw, candid, and inspiring\u2014the ultimate story of rock and redemption.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2009", "language": "english", "pages": "288 / 310", "ISBN10": "0061662496", "ISBN13": "9780061662492", "file": "PDF, 12.06 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/945089", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/945089/f62a24"},

It is new because it combines elements of many existing types of writing, yet in the end fits into none of them. At one level, it may be read as an account of how a puny, bookish boy discovered the importance of his own physical being; the \"sun and steel\" of the title are themselves symbols respectively of the cult of the open air and the weights used in bodybuilding. At another level, it is a discussion by a major novelist of the relation between action and art, and his own highly polished art in particular. More personally, it is an account of one individual's search for identity and self-integration. Or again, the work could be seen as a demonstration of how an intensely individual preoccupation can be developed into a profound philosophy of life.All these elements are woven together by Mishima's complex yet polished and supple style. The confession and the self-analysis, the philosophy and the poetry combine in the end to create something that is in itself perfect and self-sufficient. It is a piece of literature that is as carefully fashioned as Mishima's novels, and at the same time provides an indispensable key to the understanding of them as art.The road Mishima took to salvation is a highly personal one. Yet here, ultimately, one detects the unmistakable tones of a self transcending the particular and attaining to a poetic vision of the universal. The book is therefore a moving document, and is highly significant as a pointer to the future development of one of the most interesting novelists of modern times.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2003", "edition": "1st Edition from 1970 - Translated by John Bester", "publisher": "Kodansha USA", "language": "english", "pages": "108 / 100", "ISBN10": "4770029039", "ISBN13": "9784770029034", "file": "PDF, 415 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2090537", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2090537/5e6d7f"},

For nearly a quarter of a century, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were Hollywood royalty, and their fiery romance\u2014often called \"the marriage of the century\"\u2014was the most notorious, publicized, and celebrated love affair of its day.   For the first time, Vanity Fair contributing editor Sam Kashner and acclaimed biographer Nancy Schoenberger tell the complete story of this larger-than-life couple, showing how their romance and two marriages commanded the attention of the world. Also for the first time, in exclusive access given to the authors, Elizabeth Taylor herself gives never-revealed details and firsthand accounts of her life with Burton.   Drawing upon brand-new information and interviews\u2014and on Burton's private, passionate, and heartbreaking letters to Taylor\u2014Furious Love sheds new light on the movies, the sex, the scandal, the fame, the brawls, the booze, the bitter separations, and, of course, the fabled jewels. It offers an intimate glimpse into Elizabeth and Richard's privileged world and their elite circle of friends, among them Princess Grace, Montgomery Clift, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Peter O'Toole, Michael Caine, Marlon Brando, Rex Harrison, Mike Nichols, Laurence Olivier, Robert Kennedy, Tennessee Williams, No\u00cbl Coward, John Huston, Ava Gardner, the Rothschilds, Maria Callas, and Aristotle Onassis. It provides an entertaining, eye-opening look at their films, their wildly lucrative reign in Europe and in Hollywood\u2014and the price they paid for their extravagant lives.   Shocking and unsparing in its honesty, Furious Love explores the very public marriage of \"Liz and Dick\" as well as the private struggles of Elizabeth and Richard, including Le Scandale, their affair on the set of the notorious epic Cleopatra that earned them condemnation from the Vatican; Burton's hardscrabble youth in Wales; the crippling alcoholism that nearly destroyed his career and contributed to his early death; the medical issues that plagued both him and Elizabeth; and the failed aspirations and shame that haunted him throughout their relationship. As Kashner and Schoenberger illuminate the events and choices that shaped this illustrious couple's story, they demonstrate how the legendary pair presaged America's changing attitudes toward sex, marriage, morality, and celebrity. Yet ultimately, as the authors show, Elizabeth and Richard shared something priceless beyond the drama: enduring love.   Addictive and entertaining, Furious Love is more than a celebrity biography; it's an honest yet sympathetic portrait of a man, a woman, and a passion that shocked and mesmerized the world.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Harper", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9780061562846", "file": "EPUB, 4.48 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1231724/1d96aa"},

As music critic for the Los Angeles Times, Hilburn knew Cash well throughout his life: he was the only music journalist at the legendary Folsom Prison concert in 1968, and he interviewed Cash and his wife June Carter for the final time just months before their deaths in 2003. Hilburn's rich reporting shows the remarkable highs and deep lows that followed and haunted Cash in equal measure. A man of great faith and humbling addiction, Cash aimed for more than another hit on the jukebox; he wanted to use his music to lift people's spirits and help promote what he felt was the best of the American spirit.Drawing upon his personal experience with Cash and a trove of never-before-seen material from the singer's inner circle, Hilburn creates an utterly compelling, deeply human portrait of one of the most iconic figures in modern popular culture - not only a towering figure in country music, but also a seminal influence in rock, whose personal life was far more troubled, and whose musical and lyrical artistry much more profound, than even his most devoted fans ever realized.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Little, Brown and Company", "language": "english", "pages": "688", "ISBN10": "0316194751", "ISBN13": "9780316194754", "file": "EPUB, 2.24 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2210618/f834ea"},

Born in England and now living in Wyoming, Fuller was conceived and bred on African soil during the Rhodesian civil war (1971-1979), a world where children over five \"learn[ed] how to load an FN rifle magazine, strip and clean all the guns in the house, and ultimately, shoot-to-kill.\" With a unique and subtle sensitivity to racial issues, Fuller describes her parents' racism and the wartime relationships between blacks and whites through a child's watchful eyes. Curfews and war, mosquitoes, land mines, ambushes and \"an abundance of leopards\" are the stuff of this childhood. \"Dad has to go out into the bush... and find terrorists and fight them\"; Mum saves the family from an Egyptian spitting cobra; they both fight \"to keep one country in Africa white-run.\" The \"A\" schools (\"with the best teachers and facilities\") are for white children; \"B\" schools serve \"children who are neither black nor white\"; and \"C\" schools are for black children. Fuller's world is marked by sudden, drastic changes: the farm is taken away for \"land redistribution\"; one term at school, five white students are \"left in the boarding house... among two hundred African students\"; three of her four siblings die in infancy; the family constantly sets up house in hostile, desolate environments as they move from Rhodesia to Zambia to Malawi and back to Zambia. But Fuller's remarkable affection for her parents (who are racists) and her homeland (brutal under white and black rule) shines through. This affection, in spite of its subjects' prominent flaws, reveals their humanity and allows the reader direct entry into her world. Fuller's book has the promise of being widely read and remaining of interest for years to come. Photos not seen by PW. (On-sale Dec. 18)Forecast: Like Anne Frank's diary, this work captures the tone of a very young person caught up in her own small world as she witnesses a far larger historical event. It will appeal to those looking for a good story as well as anyone seeking firsthand reportage of white southern Africa. The quirky title and jacket will propel curious shoppers to pick it up.  Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.   From School Library Journal  Adult/High School-Pining for Africa, Fuller's parents departed England in the early '70s while she was still a toddler. They knew well that their life as white farmers living in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia at the time) would be anything but glamorous. Living a crude, rural life, the author and her older sister contended with \"itchy bums and worms and bites up their arms from fleas\" and losing three siblings. Mum and Dad were freewheeling, free-drinking, and often careless. Yet they were made of tough stuff and there is little doubt of the affection among family members. On top of attempting to make a living, they faced natives who were trying to free themselves of British rule, and who were understandably not thrilled to see more white bwanas settling in. Fuller portrays bigotry (her own included), segregation, and deprivation. But judging by her vivid and effortless imagery, it is clear that the rich, pungent flora and fauna of Africa have settled deeply in her bones. Snapshots scattered throughout the book enhance the feeling of intimacy and adventure. A photo of the author's first day of boarding school seems ordinary enough- she's standing in front of the family's Land Rover, smiling with her mother and sister. Then the realization strikes that young Alexandra is holding an Uzi (which she had been trained to use) and the family car had been mine-proofed. This was no ordinary childhood, and it makes a riveting story thanks to an extraordinary telling.   *Sheila Shoup, Fairfax County Public Library, VA *   Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2001", "publisher": "Random House Trade Paperbacks", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9780375758997", "file": "MOBI , 411 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1233427/86b922"},

In this controversial polemic, Scott Lucas argues that the exaltation of Orwell, far from upholding dissent against the State, has sought to quash such opposition. Indeed, Orwell has become the icon of those who, in the pose of the contrarian, try to silence public opposition to US and U K foreign policy in the 'War on Terror'.Lucas's lively and readable critique of public intellectuals including Christopher Hitchens, Michael Walzer, David Aaronovitch, and Johann Hari \u2013 who have all invoked Orwellian honesty and decency to shut down dissent \u2013 will appeal to anyone disillusioned with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Lucas contends that these leading journalists and commentators have used Orwell to justify their own political transition from radicals to upholders of the establishment. All of them play influential roles in supporting the UK and US governments' charge that opponents of war -- and those who question the motives behind American foreign policy and its implementation -- should be condemned as 'appeasers of mass murder'.This controversial book shows how Orwell has been used since 9/11 to justify, in the guise of independent thought, the suppression of dissent. We must rescue ourselves from Orwell and from those who take on his guise so, as Lucas puts it, our \u2018silencing is\u2026 vital to a \"manufacture of consent\" for the wars which are supposedly being fought in our name and for our good\u2019.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2004", "language": "english", "pages": "336 / 331", "ISBN10": "0745321976", "ISBN13": "9781435662025", "file": "PDF, 2.05 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/859925", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/859925/0f944e"},

Yet even as her work has found new popularity in the last few years, the life of this famously elusive writer has remained a mystery. For Beautiful Shadow, the first biography of Highsmith, British journalist Andrew Wilson mined the vast archive of diaries, notebooks, and letters she left behind, astonishing in their candor and detail. He interviewed her closest friends and colleagues as well as some of her many lovers. But Wilson also traces Highsmith's literary roots in the work of Poe, noir, and existentialism, locating the influences that helped distinguish Highsmith's writing so startlingly from more ordinary thrillers.

Drawing on the personal journals Kazin kept for over 60 years, private correspondence, and numerous conversations with Kazin, he uncovers the full story of the lonely, stuttering boy from Jewish Brownsville who became a pioneering critic and influential cultural commentator.\u00a0Upon the appearance of On Native Grounds in 1942, Kazin was dubbed \u201cthe boy wonder of American criticism.\u201d Numerous publications followed, including A Walker in the City and two other memoirs, books of criticism, as well as a stream of essays and reviews that ceased only with his death in 1998. Cook tells of Kazin\u2019s childhood, his troubled marriages, and his relations with such figures as Lionel Trilling, Saul Bellow, Malcolm Cowley, Arthur Schlesinger, Hannah Arendt, and Daniel Bell. He illuminates Kazin\u2019s thinking on political-cultural issues and the recurring way in which his subject\u2019s personal life shaped his career as a public intellectual. Particular attention is paid to Kazin\u2019s sense of himself as a Jewish-American \u201cloner\u201d whose inner estrangements gave him insight into the divisions at the heart of modern culture.\u00a0 (20090224)", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2008", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Yale University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "463", "ISBN10": "0300115059", "ISBN13": "9780300115055", "file": "PDF, 1.19 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1094669", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1094669/fa6148"},

And a plumber.Q: This is your first book. Had you ever considered writing anything before? A novel? Or a work of historical scholarship? Or a children's story?KG: I had not considered it, because I'd always been told by the nuns at St. Bernadine's that my cursive was poor. A children' s story is an interesting idea. How's this for a title: \"Waterboarding Pre-Teens: The Debate is Back On.\" I have a political side as well.Q: You seem fairly obsessed with Oprah. Is this something you'll ever outgrow?KG: I will never outgrow my obsession with Oprah. Just as she will never outgrow her cardigan sweaters. Oops, she already has. Now look, that sounds like a dig, but it's not. It's called a struggle, and I'm on it with her. I support her. (Not as much as she needs those underwire bras to support her, because she's got some serious ropes and pulleys going on there.) The point is, I worship her, and fear her at the same time. And believe me, that' s how she wants it. Don't be fooled.Q: Did I miss something? Where's Celine Dion in this book?KG: I didn't write about Celine Dion, only because of my fear of her husband Rene Angelil. I have an unfounded but constant fear that he could be in the French-Canadian mafia. Or have French-Canadian mafia ties, and by ties I don't mean les cravats. And I fear that I may be abducted, whisked away and held prisoner at a charming little brasserie in Montreal, forced to eat multiple Croque Monsieur sandwiches until I confess to knowing the lyrics to every single one of her songs.Q: What do you think gays should take away from reading this book?KG: I think the gays should be happy with this book. It talks a lot about being who you are, and I certainly mention a lot of gay people. I would say it definitely has strong gay themes, and the gay community should know that frankly it has been a moral struggle for me to even acknowledge the heterosexual community in this book at all. But I am slowly reaching out an olive branch to the heterosexual community, even though I believe everything they do goes against the teachings of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But I'm trying not to judge them.Q: Describe your ideal, make-a-wish day of personal experiences with bats**t celebrities.KG: Well, it would start with some sort of a fit in the hair-and-makeup trailer on a set. I heard a story that when Sharon Stone was working on \"Casino,\" she got into such a fight with her hairdresser, that after he spent four hours doing this beautiful bouffant hairdo for her, she got up and walked in the sink and put her head underwater. I have no idea if that's true, but I hope it is, cause that's some awesome s**t I would love to see. Then it would go right to lunch, where I could witness an eating disorder. Maybe a Lohan is purging in a bush somewhere with her finger down her throat. Or perhaps there's an Olsen twin on a scale crying because she finally tipped 100. Any outburst over weight I would cherish. Also, it would be great to see an actress have a workload meltdown. So maybe at 2:00 some A-lister saying, \"I can't handle this s**t anymore.\" Because I love when actors can't deal with a normal workday, and they think two in the afternoon is like midnight, so I would love to see somebody storming to their car, exhausted because they've put in a grueling four-hour workday of saying three lines and texting their nanny. Then it's maybe off to an illicit affair. At the top of my wish list would be following a rapper or a football player over to his baby mama's house where a screaming match ensues to the point where someone, maybe me, has to anonymously dial 911, and then I take a couple pictures, and I become an unannounced star witness later at the trial, entering Joan Collins-style in a smashing hat. And then at the end of the day it's a healthy round of clubbing with Janice Dickinson, and then on the way home we go to the Beverly Glen pharmacy and run into Paula Abdul. All three of us secretly take our small white-paper pharmacy bags and put them behind our backs and make uncomfortable small talk.Official Book Club Selection is Kathy Griffin unplugged, uncensored, and unafraid to dish about what really happens on the road, away from the cameras, and at the star party after the show. (It's also her big chance to score that coveted book club endorsement she's always wanted. Are you there, Oprah? It's me, Kathy.)Kathy Griffin has won Emmys for her reality show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, been nominated for a Grammy, worked and walked every red carpet known to man, and rung in the New Year with Anderson Cooper. But the legions of fans who pack Kathy's sold-out comedy shows have heard only part of her remarkable story. Writing with her trademark wit, the feisty comic settles a few old scores, celebrates the friends and mentors who helped her claw her way to the top, and shares insider gossip about celebrity behavior\u2013the good, the bad, and the very ugly. She recounts the crazy ups and downs of her own career and introduces us to some of the supertalented people she encountered before they got famous (or, in some cases, after fame went to their heads). Word to the wise: If you've ever crossed Kathy Griffin at some point in your life, check the index for your name.Along the way, Kathy reveals intimate details about her life before and after she made the big time. She opens up about everything from growing up with a dysfunctional family in suburban Illinois to bombing as a young comedian in L.A., from her well-publicized plastic surgery disasters to her highly publicized divorce, and more. Only in this book will you learn how the dinner table is the best training ground for a career in stand-up, how speaking your mind can bite you on the ass and buy you a house, and which people in Kathy's life have taught her the most valuable lessons\u2013both inside and outside the entertainment industry. And as if all that wasn't enough, there are also dozens of exclusive and somewhat embarrassing photos from Kathy's own collection\u2013featuring the diva of the D List herself, with her old nose as well as her new one, plus celebrity friends, foes, frenemies, and hangers-on for you to gawk at.Refreshingly candid, unflinchingly honest, and full of hilarious \"Did she really say that?\" moments, Official Book Club Selection will make you laugh until you cry, or just puke up a little bit.From the Hardcover edition.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2009", "publisher": "Ballantine Books", "language": "english", "pages": "368", "ISBN10": "0345518519", "ISBN13": "9780345518514", "file": "EPUB, 2.06 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2209351/9de3a3"},

Who is Tracy Morgan? The wildly unpredictable funnyman who rocketed to fame on Saturday Night Live? The Emmy-nominated actor behind the sly and ingenious character Tracy Jordan on the award-winning hit sitcom 30 Rock, whose turbulent personal life often mirrors that of his fictional alter ego? Is he Chico Divine, the life of the party--any party, anytime, anywhere, getting ladies pregnant everywhere he goes? Or is he a soulful, tender family man who emerged from a hardscrabble ghetto upbringing and against all odds achieved superstardom, raised a solid family, prevailed over a collection of lethal bad habits, and is still ascending new heights and coming into his own? The answer is: Tracy Morgan is all that. And then some.     When he was just a boy living in the Coney Island projects, being funny was about survival. With the right snap, Tracy could shut down the playground bullies who beat up on him and his physically disabled older brother. And with a wild enough prank, he could exact revenge on whoever stole his Pumas at the community pool. Later, being funny was about escape--from the untouchable sadness of his father\u2019s death, from the desperation of the drug dealer\u2019s trade, from the life and death battles waged on the streets of the South Bronx in the age of crack. But these days being funny is about living his dream--a dream born in the comedy clubs of Harlem and realized on shows like Martin and Saturday Night Live, where he was a cast member for seven years, and in movies like The Longest Yard and Half-Baked.      With brutal honesty and his trademark take-no-prisoners humor, Tracy tells the story of his rise to fame, with all its highs and its many lows--from the very public battles with alcohol and diabetes that threatened his career and his life to the private and poignant end of his twenty-year marriage. In his singularly warped and brilliant way he muses on family, love, sex, race, politics, ambition, and what it takes to bring the funny.     Howlingly funny, inspiring, searing, and touching, I Am the New Black is a fascinating peek inside the mind of one of the most compelling and defining comedians of our time.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2009", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Spiegel & Grau", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0385527772", "ISBN13": "9780385527774", "file": "EPUB, 6.83 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1055678/e57b31"},

The book also evokes an astonishingly creative moment in English literature, when London was a battleground for new, ambitious kinds of writing. A generation that included W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, Robert Frost and Rupert Brooke were 'making it new' - vehemently and pugnaciously. These larger-than-life characters surround a central figure, tormented by his work and his marriage. But as his friendship with Frost blossomed, Thomas wrote poem after poem, and his emotional affliction began to lift. In 1914 the two friends formed the ideas that would produce some of the most remarkable verse of the twentieth century. But the War put an ocean between them: Frost returned to the safety of New England while Thomas stayed to fight for the Old. It is these roads taken - and those not taken - that are at the heart of this remarkable book, which culminates in Thomas's tragic death on Easter Monday 1917.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Faber & Faber", "language": "english", "pages": "416", "ISBN10": "0571245986", "ISBN13": "9780571245987", "file": "EPUB, 1.62 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1280481/0a8821"},

They then tell of his decade-long term as Bavarian music director and his romantic involvement with the soprano Delia Reinhardt; his other positions in the musical community until he was ousted from Germany when the Nazi Party came to power in 1933; and his return to Vienna, where he was artistic director of the Opera House until he was again forced out by the Nazis. Finally they trace his career in the United States, where he led the New York Philharmonic and other orchestras and in his last years made numerous recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble created especially for him. Ryding and Pechefsky are the first biographers to make extensive use of the thousands of unpublished letters in the Bruno Walter Papers, now in the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.  In addition to interviewing more than sixty people who knew Walter, they examined countless reviews to assess the popular and critical impact he had on his time.

What are we to make of someone whose life, both personal and professional, hit such dazzling highs and such abysmal lows? Stefan Kanfer answers this question, in the process giving us the final word on one of the most astonishing talents of the twentieth century.Born in Nebraska in 1924, Marlon grew up unaffected by the Depression but scarred by a brutal father and fatally alcoholic mother. After a turbulent childhood, Brando made his great escape to 1940s New York and fell in love with a city bristling with postwar optimism and vibrancy. Soon New York fell in love with him, too\u2014his stunning Broadway debut as Stanley Kowalski made him an instant star at age twenty-three.Brando then decamped for Hollywood, and Kanfer illuminates his performances in early movies like The Men, Julius Caesar, and On the Waterfront. Starting in the late fifties and continuing throughout the sixties, though, Brando transformed from bright young star into something more complicated. By looking at such films as The Young Lions, One-Eyed Jacks\u2014the one and only movie he ever directed\u2014and Mutiny on the Bounty, Kanfer gives us a real understanding of Brando's breathtaking talent and sexual power while also giving us a sense of the vulnerable man behind the towering image. Through assessments of his performances in critically panned movies like Reflections in a Golden Eye, Candy, and The Appaloosa, an intricately woven portrait emerges\u2014showing not only Brando\u2019s genius, but also his self-destructiveness, womanizing, constant dissembling, and evolving ambivalence toward his fame and his craft.With the role of Don Corleone, Brando pulled himself out of his slump for his career\u2019s third and perhaps most interesting act; Kanfer turns his critical eye on The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, and Last Tango in Paris, the last arguably Brando\u2019s most intimate and disturbing appearance onscreen. After these, it was once again a downhill slalom for Brando, both professionally (the movies he made in the last fifteen years of his life were hardly worthy of him) and personally, as he lived out his finale in the shadow of horrific family tragedies.With the surest of hands, Kanfer gives us the first truly comprehensive examination, not only of a life and a career, but of how the two came together to create the icon we know as Brando.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2008", "publisher": "Alfred A.

And, since Grodin is one of the best storytellers around, he can't help but entertain while offering insight gained from a wealth of experience.The combination of being impeached as class president by his fifth grade teacher (and then winning many school elections thereafter) with being thrown out of Hebrew School for asking too many questions (only to find a much better teacher as a result) informed Grodin's view of himself and made him adept at dealing with rejection--an important skill for an actor.  Grodin's success in plays in high school and adventures in college theater led him to a career in acting, studying with the great teachers like Uta Hagen and Lee Strasberg.  Grodin shares behind-the-scenes tales of working on plays like Same Time Next Year and movies like The Heartbreak Kid and Midnight Run--even how close he came to playing the lead in The Graduate.  His stories feature the many actors, directors, writers, and producers, with whom he's worked, such as Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Johnny Carson, Orson Welles, Warren Beatty, and other colorful characters.  Grodin's greatest work isn't limited to stage and screen, however.  He has been an award winning talk show host and commentator on Sixty Minutes II, and he reveals insights about the political and personal side of journalism and some of the larger-than-life characters he's interviewed.  Still, it is the personal aspects of Grodin's life that are truly revealing and funny.  He shares intimate anecdotes of humorous dating experiences during the carefree 70s along with stories of what it was like to be a young actor then with friends and colleagues like Robert Redford, Gene Wilder, and Dustin Hoffman.But it is Grodin's tales of the lives he's helped save with his relentless advocacy work that make you realize what a great guy Charles Grodin really is.  We are lucky that the nice guy his friends call, \"Chuck\" brings us along to share a little of his journey of how he got to be who he really is!The author is donating 100 percent of his royalties from sales of this book to Mentoring USA, a New York City based nonprofit that forges powerful, transformative connections for young people through the advocacy and involvement of mentors.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2009", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Grand Central Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "253", "ISBN10": "0446519405", "ISBN13": "9780446519403", "file": "EPUB, 1.05 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2208714/aaf8a1"},

The book's mostly chronological, \r\nand includes e.g., Bentine's childhood and his experiences in WW2 \r\n(including as an Intelligence Officer).As a slant on the \r\nparanormal, it's unusual.  There are various I'm sure legitimate \r\naccounts of remarkable experiences, but there are no or few mentions of \r\n(what I think of as) the usual suspects (maybe Frederic Myers, Edgar \r\nCayce, Jane Sherwood, Eileen Garrett etc.) and usual themes (e.g., \r\nreincarnation, planes in the afterlife, Akashic records, karma) and - \r\nand this is what surprised me - there are many references to black \r\nmagic, to rituals that give access to \"altered states of experience\" (my\r\n term), to the demonstrated dangers of meddling with dark forces, to \r\nancient groups (e.g., the Knights Templar and the Freemasons) that held \r\nsecret knowledge.  Bentine says that Stephen Ward (of Profumo infamy), \r\nbut also e.g., Rasputin, Hitler, Hess, and Nietzsche dabbled in the \r\n\"dark arts\" and paid the price in one way or another.I wasn't \r\nquite persuaded.  Though Bentine was very critical of crass materialism,\r\n he seems too deeply rooted in matter, and didn't distance himself \r\nsufficiently from material interpretations of what's is/was going on.  \r\nHe both warns against dabbling which he says has great dangers and seems\r\n to be coming at things from a black magic or occult point of view.  For\r\n example, he says Stephen Ward was into Satanism and that Wards house \r\nwas so badly affected it had to be exorcised after his death.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Education Biography", "publisher": "Granada", "language": "english", "pages": "294", "file": "PDF, 770 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/17302184", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/17302184/2785d9"},

J. Alhabeeb", "Veechi Curtis"], "rating": "0", "description": "An unforgettable, unconventional narrative that examines the many ways to be fully human, told by the first young adult with autism to attend Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. As a child, Jory Fleming was wracked by uncontrollable tantrums, had no tolerance for people, and couldn\u2019t manage the outside world. Slightly more than a decade later, he was bound for England, selected to attend one of the world\u2019s premier universities. How to Be Human explores life amid a world constructed for neurotypical brains when yours is not. But the miracle of this book is that instead of dwelling on Jory\u2019s limitations, those who inhabit the neurotypical world will begin to better understand their own: they will contemplate what language cannot say, how linear thinking leads to dead ends, and how nefarious emotions can be, particularly when, in Jory\u2019s words, they are \u201cweaponized.\u201d Through a series of deep, personal conversations with writer Lyric Winik, Jory makes a compelling case for logical empathy based on rational thought, asks why we tolerate friends who see us as a means to an end, and explains why he believes personality is a choice. Most movingly, he discusses how, after many hardships, he maintains a deep, abiding faith: \u201cWith people, I don\u2019t understand what goes in and what comes out, and how to relate,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can always reconnect with my relationship with my Creator.\u201d Join Jory and Lyric as they examine what it means to be human and ultimately how each of us might become a better one. Jory asks us to consider: Who has value? What is a disability? And how do we correct the imbalances we see in the world? How to Be Human shows us the ways a beautifully different mind can express the very best of our shared humanity.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Education Biography", "year": "2021", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "language": "english", "pages": "191", "ISBN13": "9781501180507", "file": "EPUB, 3.65 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/12120199/f6aee0"},

In the face of these social, political, and cultural conditions, Hollywood was under siege: from the Justice Department, which pressed for big film companies to divest themselves of their theater holdings; from the middle class, whose retreat to family entertainment inside the home drastically decreased the filmgoing audience; and from the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was attempting to purge the country of dissenting political views. In this difficult context, however, some of the most talented filmmakers of all time, including John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Vincente Minnelli, Nicholas Ray, and Billy Wilder produced some of their most remarkable work.    Bringing together original essays by ten respected scholars in the field, American Cinema of the 1950s explores the impact of the cultural environment of this decade on film, and the impact of film on the American cultural milieu. Contributors examine signature films of the decade, including From Here to Eternity, Sunset Blvd., Singin\u2019 in the Rain, Shane, Rear Window, and Rebel Without a Cause, as well as lesser-known but equally compelling films, such as Dial 1119, Mystery Street, Suddenly, Summer Stock, The Last Hunt, Bitter Victory, and many others.    Provocative, engaging, and accessible to general readers as well as scholars, this volume provides a unique lens through which to view the links between film and the prevailing social and historical events of the 1950s.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Artists, Architects & Photographers", "year": "2005", "language": "english", "pages": "320 / 321", "ISBN10": "0813535654", "ISBN13": "9780813537795", "file": "PDF, 1.09 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/841026", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/841026/8630b9"},

Komrij produceerde in zijn leven een verbluffende hoeveelheid werk en geldt nog altijd als een van de meest dwarse denkers van de Nederlandse literatuur. Voor De kuren van Komrij maakte Onno Blom een keuze uit het glansrijke oeuvre van Gerrit Komrij. Via stukken over zijn jeugd, zijn meest vileine polemieken en maatschappijkritieken - met onder meer aanvallen op zondagsdichters, 'de treurbuis' en 'de onwelriekende gleuvenbrigade' - en zijn liefde voor literatuur toont Blom de fabuleuze veelzijdigheid van de schrijver. Komrij was een lieflijke houwdegen, een misantroop die van mensen houdt, een ernstige humorist, een vitale pessimist. 'Ik weet niet wat links of rechts is. Ik voel me niet vervreemd of verscheurd. Ik aanvaard de versplintering van de wereldbeelden als een godsgeschenk. Ik ben de eerste gelukkige schizo.' Onno Blom (1969) is schrijver, biograaf en literair criticus.

As vinte entrevistas reunidas em \u201cFico besta quando me entendem\u201d, foram feitas de 1952 a 2002 em diversas ocasi\u00f5es, como o lan\u00e7amento de um de seus t\u00edtulos, a estreia de uma de suas pe\u00e7as ou, mais tarde, em uma homenagem e tentativa de compreender sua obra. Mais do que pretender dar voz \u00e0s queixas que foram respons\u00e1veis por uma imagem muitas vezes arredia da autora, a reuni\u00e3o dessas conversas \u00e9 uma preciosa aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o de seu universo, da forma como Hilda encarava a vida, a literatura, os amigos, o amor e a morte. E desvendam, ao longo de vinte anos, uma mulher sens\u00edvel, bem humorada, \u00e1vida por ser lida \u2013 n\u00e3o apenas por vaidade, mas pela certeza de ter o que comunicar. Considerada uma das mais importantes escritoras contempor\u00e2neas do Brasil, Hilda Hilst produziu, ao longo de cinquenta anos, um universo liter\u00e1rio composto de poesia, teatro, prosa de fic\u00e7\u00e3o e cr\u00f4nicas. Seu texto, muitas vezes considerado controverso pela cr\u00edtica, \u00e9 denso, duro, viril, mas mant\u00e9m o lirismo da poeta e a vontade de comunicar os mist\u00e9rios do mundo.

Muitas vezes tida como obscura, \u00e1rida e mesmo obscena, Hilda, na conversa pessoal, bem-humorada e explicativa, tendo como interlocutores leitores finos e amigos \u00edntimos, demonstra nessa reuni\u00e3o de conversas uma s\u00e9ria consci\u00eancia na constru\u00e7\u00e3o de sua obra e uma an\u00e1lise perspicaz de sua personalidade.

P-Orridge rose to notoriety as the founder of the COUM Transmissions art collective, which operated in Britain from 1969 to 1976. P-Orridge cofounded and fronted the pioneering industrial band Throbbing Gristle and the experimental multi-media outfit Psychic TV, paralleled by P-Orridge\u2019s cofounding of the communal network Temple Ov Psychick Youth. In 1996, P-Orridge and partner Lady Jaye embarked on the Pandrogyne Project, a living art concept that blended physical and psychological mediums, creating the unified \u201cBreyer P-Orridge.\u201d In recent years, P-Orridge performed with their spoken word project Thee Majesty, which in the past included such collaborators as William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Timothy Leary, Monte Cazazza, Aaron Dilloway, Merz-bow, Tony Conrad, and countless others. P-Orridge also continued perform-ing sold-out shows all over the world with PTV3, an iteration of Psychic TV that spanned almost two decades. Over the past fifty years, P-Orridge\u2019s art-works have been exhibited in hundreds of museums and galleries across the world, cementing P-Orridge\u2019s prolific career of contributions to Fluxus, mail art, collage, sound poetry, and conceptual art. The archives of Genesis P-Orridge were acquired for the permanent collection of London\u2019s Tate Britain in 2010.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Film, Television & Music", "year": "2021", "publisher": "Abrams", "language": "english", "file": "PDF, 12.32 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/16454017", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16454017/c11a21"},

Everyone is free to copy, reproduce, and disseminate this book without fear of copyright infringement.December 2001 was the beginning of the long, arduous journey for Michael Peterson, who was accused, placed on trial, and convicted of murdering his second wife, Kathleen Peterson. In Behind the Staircase, a memoir, Peterson recounts the events leading up to the incident which would forever change his life.After spending eight years at the Nash Correctional Institution and several attempts at appeal, Peterson filed an Alford Plea, changing his original plea from not guilty to that of guilty yet still asserting his innocence. His sentence was converted to voluntary manslaughter and he was subsequently released from prison for time served. Having spent 98 and a half months behind bars for allegedly killing his wife, Peterson was finally a free man.In Behind the Staircase, Peterson shares the devastating events of Kathleen\u2019s death, his trial and conviction for murder, and the many grueling years that he spent with murderers, rapists, gangbangers, and pedophiles. In Peterson\u2019s own words, he painstakingly describes what his life has been like since that fateful night nearly twenty years ago and what it has meant to him to be ultimately released from prison.Peterson\u2019s story has been featured in many film and miniseries episodes, each sharing its own twist of events based on the original trial, interviews with jurors, and the retrial proceedings.

A native of South Carolina and son of Henry Laurens, president of the Continental Congress, John devoted his life to securing American independence.In this comprehensive biography, Gregory D. Massey recounts the young Laurens's wartime record \u2015a riveting tale in its own right \u2015and finds that even more remarkable than his military escapades were his revolutionary ideas concerning the rights of African Americans.Massey relates Laurens's desperation to fight for his country once revolution had begun. A law student in England, he joined the war effort in 1777, leaving behind his English wife and an unborn child he would never see. Massey tells of the young officer's devoted service as General George Washington's aide-de-camp, interaction with prominent military and political figures, and conspicuous military efforts at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Newport, Charleston, Savannah, and Yorktown. Massey also recounts Laurens's survival of four battle wounds and six months as a prisoner of war, his controversial diplomatic mission to France, and his close friendship with Alexander Hamilton. Laurens's death in a minor battle in August 1782 was a tragic loss for the new state and nation.Unlike other prominent southerners, Laurens believed blacks shared a similar nature with whites, and he formulated a plan to free slaves in return for their service in the Continental Army. Massey explores the personal, social, and cultural factors that prompted Laurens to diverge so radically from his peers and to raise vital questions about the role African Americans would play in the new republic.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - General & Miscellaneous Biography", "year": "2016", "publisher": "University of South Carolina Press", "language": "english", "file": "EPUB, 853 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16804314/adc435"},

Devastating in its honesty, Vanessa's painstakingly memoir lays bare the cultural attitudes and circumstances that made it possible for a thirteen-year-old girl to become involved with a fifty-year-old man who happened to be a notable writer. As she recalls the events of her childhood and her seduction by one of her country's most notable writers, Vanessa reflects on the ways in which this disturbing relationship changed and affected her as she grew older.\n\r\nDrawing parallels between children's fairy tales and French history and her personal life, Vanessa offers an intimate and absorbing look at the meaning of love and consent and the toll of trauma and the power of healing in women's lives.

Even as her face covered WANTED posters throughout Europe, Virginia refused order after order to evacuate. She finally escaped with her life in a grueling hike over the Pyrenees into Spain, her cover blown, and her associates all imprisoned or executed. But, adamant that she had \"more lives to save,\" she dove back in as soon as she could, organizing forces to sabotage enemy lines and back up Allied forces landing on Normandy beaches.

With his longtime collaborator Mark Olshaker, Douglas recounts the chilling encounters with these four killers as he experienced them\u2014revealing for the first time his profile methods in detail. \n\r\nGoing step by step through his interviews, Douglas explains how he connects each killer\u2019s crimes to the specific conversation, and contrasts these encounters with those of other deadly criminals to show what he learns from each one. In the process, he returns to other famous cases, killers and interviews that have shaped his career, describing how the knowledge he gained from those exchanges helped prepare him for these.\n\r\nA glimpse into the mind of a man who has pierced the heart of human darkness, The Killer Across the Table unlocks the ultimate mystery of depravity and the techniques and approaches that have countered evil in the name of justice.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2019", "edition": "Original retail", "publisher": "Dey Street Books", "language": "english", "pages": "352", "ISBN10": "006291152X", "ISBN13": "9780062911520", "file": "EPUB, 2.50 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5002475/c5b03b"},

The legendary Omaha investor has never written a memoir, but now he has allowed one writer, Alice Schroeder, unprecedented access to explore directly with him and with those closest to him his work, opinions, struggles, triumphs, follies, and wisdom. The result is the personally revealing and complete biography of the man known everywhere as \u0432\u0402\u045aThe Oracle of Omaha.\u0432\u0402\u045c  Although the media track him constantly, Buffett himself has never told his full life story. His reality is private, especially by celebrity standards. Indeed, while the homespun persona that the public sees is true as far as it goes, it goes only so far. Warren Buffett is an array of paradoxes. He set out to prove that nice guys can finish first. Over the years he treated his investors as partners, acted as their steward, and championed honesty as an investor, CEO, board member, essayist, and speaker. At the same time he became the world\u0432\u0402\u2122s richest man, all from the modest Omaha headquarters of his company Berkshire Hathaway. None of this fits the term \u0432\u0402\u045asimple.\u0432\u0402\u045c  When Alice Schroeder met Warren Buffett she was an insurance industry analyst and a gifted writer known for her keen perception and business acumen. Her writings on finance impressed him, and as she came to know him she realized that while much had been written on the subject of his investing style, no one had moved beyond that to explore his larger philosophy, which is bound up in a complex personality and the details of his life. Out of this came his decision to cooperate with her on the book about himself that he would never write.  Never before has Buffett spent countless hours responding to a writer\u0432\u0402\u2122s questions, talking, giving complete access to his wife, children, friends, and business associates\u0432\u0402\u201dopening his files, recalling his childhood. It was an act of courage, as The Snowball  makes immensely clear. Being human, his own life, like most lives, has been a mix of strengths and frailties. Yet notable though his wealth may be, Buffett\u0432\u0402\u2122s legacy will not be his ranking on the scorecard of wealth; it will be his principles and ideas that have enriched people\u0432\u0402\u2122s lives.

A modern alloy of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs, Musk is the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of which has sent shock waves throughout American business and industry. More than any other executive today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as a science fiction fantasy. In this lively, investigative account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life and times of Silicon Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than fifty hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to three hundred people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies and to paint a portrait of a complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation\u2014all while making plenty of enemies along the way. In 1992, Elon Musk arrived in the United States as a ferociously driven immigrant bent on realizing his wildest dreams. Since then, Musk's roller-coaster life has brought him grave disappointments alongside massive successes. After being forced out of PayPal, fending off a life-threatening case of malaria, and dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned Silicon Valley for Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars. Cut to 2012, however, and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business history: Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's net worth soared to more than $5 billion. At a time when many American companies are more interested in chasing easy money than in taking bold risks on radical new technology, Musk stands out as the only businessman with enough dynamism and vision to tackle\u2014and even revolutionize\u2014three industries at once.

One phrase in particular anchored itself in listeners\u2019 minds, a reminder that for all the discord and struggle to be found in our history as a nation, we have always been guided by a dogged optimism in the future, or what Obama called \u201cthe audacity of hope.\u201dThe Audacity of Hope\u00a0is Barack Obama\u2019s call for a different brand of politics\u2014a politics for those weary of bitter partisanship\u00a0and alienated by the \u201cendless clash of armies\u201d we see in congress and on the campaign trail; a politics rooted in the faith, inclusiveness, and nobility of spirit at the heart of \u201cour improbable experiment in democracy.\u201d He explores those forces\u2014from the fear of losing to the perpetual need to raise money to the power of the media\u2014that can stifle even the best-intentioned politician. He also writes, with surprising intimacy and self-deprecating humor, about settling in as a senator, seeking to balance the demands of public service and family life, and his own deepening religious commitment.At the heart of this book is Barack Obama\u2019s vision of how we can move beyond our divisions to tackle concrete problems. He examines the growing economic insecurity of American families, the racial and religious tensions within the body politic, and the transnational threats\u2014from terrorism to pandemic\u2014that gather beyond our shores. And he grapples with the role that faith plays in a democracy\u2014where it is vital and where it must never intrude. Underlying his stories\u00a0is a vigorous search for connection: the foundation for a radically hopeful political consensus.Only by returning to the principles that gave birth to our Constitution,\u00a0Obama\u00a0says, can Americans repair a political process that is broken, and restore to working order a government that has fallen dangerously out of touch with millions of ordinary Americans. Those Americans are out there, he writes\u2014\u201cwaiting for Republicans and Democrats to catch up with them.\u201d", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2008", "edition": "Reprint", "publisher": "Crown Publishers", "language": "english", "pages": "464 / 217", "ISBN10": "0307455874", "ISBN13": "9780307455871", "file": "PDF, 2.59 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/623583", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/623583/765cae"},

Nonetheless, Zafar\u2014a mystic, poet, and calligrapher of great accomplishment\u2014created a court of unparalleled brilliance, and gave rise to perhaps the greatest literary renaissance in modern Indian history. All the while, the British were progressively taking over the Emperor's power.

Sebestyen traces the story from Lenin's early years to his long exile in Europe and return to Petrograd in 1917 to lead the first Communist revolution in history. Uniquely, Sebestyen has discovered that throughout Lenin's life his closest relationships were with his mother, his sisters, his wife, and his mistress. The long-suppressed story told here of the love triangle that Lenin had with his wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and his beautiful, married mistress and comrade, Inessa Armand, reveals a more complicated character than that of the coldly one-dimensional leader of the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\r\nWith Lenin's personal papers and those of other leading political figures now available, Sebestyen gives is new details that bring to life the dramatic and gripping story of how Lenin seized power in a coup and ran his revolutionary state. The product of a violent, tyrannical, and corrupt Russia, he chillingly authorized the deaths of thousands of people and created a system based on the idea that political terror against opponents was justified for a greater ideal. An old comrade what had once admired him said that Lenin \"desired the good . . . but created evil.\" This included his invention of Stalin, who would take Lenin's system of the gulag and the secret police to horrifying new heights.\n\r\nIn Lenin, Victor Sebestyen has written a brilliant portrait of this dictator as a complex and ruthless figure, and he also brings to light important new revelations about the Russian Revolution, a pivotal point in modern history.\n\r\n(With 16 pages of black-and-white photographs)\n\r\nVICTOR SEBESTYEN was born in Budapest. He has worked as a journalist on many British newspapers including The Times, the Daily Mail, and the London Evening Standard, where he was foreign editor and editorial writer. He has also written for many American publications, including The New York Times, and was an editor at Newsweek. He is author of Twelve Days: The Story of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire, and 1946: The Making of the Modern World.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2017", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Pantheon", "language": "english", "pages": "592", "ISBN10": "1101871636", "ISBN13": "9781101871638", "file": "EPUB, 27.14 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3402467/4acae9"},

From his rigorous training in Soviet intelligence in the early 1950s to his prime spot as the KGB's head of counterintelligence at the Soviet embassy in Washington, Cherkashin's career was rich in episode and drama. In a riveting memoir, Cherkashin provides a remarkable insider's view of the KGB's prolonged conflict with the CIA. Playing a major role in global espionage for most of the Cold War, Cherkashin was posted to stations in the United States, Australia, India, and Lebanon. He tracked down U.S. and British spies around the world. But it was in 1985 that Cherkashin scored two of the KGB's biggest-ever coups. In April of that year, he recruited disgruntled CIA officer Aldrich Ames and became his principal handler. Six months later, FBI special agent Robert Hanssen contacted Cherkashin directly, eventually becoming an even bigger asset than Ames. In Spy Handler, Cherkashin offers the complete account of how and why both Americans turned against their country, and addresses the rumors of an undiscovered KGB spy-another Hanssen or Ames-still at large in the U.S. intelligence community. Full of vivid detail and dramatic accounts that shed stark new light on the inner workings of the KGB, Spy Handler is a major addition to Cold War history, told by one of its major players.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2005", "publisher": "Basic Books", "language": "english", "pages": "368", "ISBN10": "0465009697", "ISBN13": "9780465009695", "file": "EPUB, 4.94 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2273615/a29224"},

This acclaimed autobiography presents a fascinating portrait of one of the great spiritual figures of our time. With engaging candor, eloquence, and wit, Paramahansa Yogananda tells the inspiring chronicle of his life: the experiences of his remarkable childhood, encounter with many saints and sages during his youthful search throughout India for an illumined teacher, ten years of training in the hermitage of a revered yoga master, and the thirty years that he lived and taught in America. Also recorded here are his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Burbank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other celebrated spiritual personalities of East and West.\n\r\nThe author clearly explains the subtle but definite laws behind both the ordinary events of everyday life and the extraordinary events commonly termed miracles. His absorbing life story becomes the background for a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence.

Trained to aggressively confront the enemy in combat, the men learn, shortly after being deployed to Iraq, that fate has assigned them a different role.

Kidnapped as a child, he had ended up a servant and bodyguard to the head of the Jesuits in Asia, with whom he traversed India and China learning multiple languages as he went. His arrival in Kyoto, however, literally caused a riot. Most Japanese people had never seen an African man before, and many of them saw him as the embodiment of the black-skinned (in local tradition) Buddha. Among those who were drawn to his presence was Lord Nobunaga, head of the most powerful clan in Japan, who made Yasuke a samurai in his court. Soon, he was learning the traditions of Japan\u2019s martial arts and ascending the upper echelons of Japanese society.\n\r\nIn the four hundred years since, Yasuke has been known in Japan largely as a legendary, perhaps mythical figure. Now African Samurai presents the never-before-told biography of this unique figure of the sixteenth century, one whose travels between countries, cultures and classes offers a new perspective on race in world history and a vivid portrait of life in medieval Japan", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "language": "english", "file": "EPUB, 12.84 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/4991402/061616"},

Bullied as a boy in the toughest, poorest neighborhood in Brooklyn, Tyson grew up to become one of the most thrilling and ferocious boxers of all time\u2014and the youngest heavyweight champion ever. But his brilliance in the ring was often compromised by reckless behavior. Years of hard partying, violent fights, and criminal proceedings took their toll: by 2003, Tyson had hit rock bottom, a convicted felon, completely broke, the punch line to a thousand bad late-night jokes. Yet he fought his way back; the man who once admitted being addicted \u201cto everything\u201d regained his success, his dignity, and the love of his family. With a triumphant one-man stage show, his unforgettable performances in the Hangover films, and his newfound happiness and stability as a father and husband, Tyson\u2019s story is an inspiring American original.Brutally honest, raw, and often hilarious, Tyson chronicles his tumultuous highs and lows in the same sincere, straightforward manner we have come to expect from this legendary athlete.

Bones are found and they are from more than one body. And so the nightmare begins. You are the daughter of Fred and Rose West.'Mae, I mean this ... I'm not a good person and I let all you children down ...' Rose West, HM PRISON DURHAMIt has taken over 20 years for Mae West to find the perspective and strength to tell her remarkable story: one of an abusive, violent childhood, of her serial killer parents and how she has rebuilt her life in the shadow of their terrible crimes.Through her own memories, research and the letters her mother wrote to her from prison, Mae shares her emotionally powerful account of her life as a West. From a toddler locked in the deathly basement to a teen fighting off the sexual advances of her father, Mae's story is one of survival. It also answers the questions: how do you come to terms with knowing your childhood bedroom was a graveyard? How do you accept the fact your parents sexually tortured, murdered and dismembered young women? How do you become a mother yourself when you're haunted by the knowledge that your own mother was a monster?

He is a universal symbol of social justice certainly; an exemplary figure connoting non-racialism and democracy; a moral giant.  For years a man cut off from the world, Mandela became after his 1990 release an internationally recognizable icon. But why should his story be important to us in the world at large today? What do his achievements signify not only nationally in South Africa but also internationally? This book is about the different, interconnected stories, histories, values and symbols that Nelson Mandela embodies. Across his life Mandela has filled a rich range of roles: handsome city-slicker, dashing guerrilla, the millennial saviour figure.  By examining these different roles as well as the principles which lie behind and motivate them, this Very Short Introduction presents an analytical portrait of a shape-shifting life.  Set within a biographical frame, the book offers a more deeply personal analysis of Mandela than biographies centred on the towering public figure have been able provide.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2008", "language": "english", "pages": "144 / 225", "ISBN10": "0192803018", "ISBN13": "9780191539244", "file": "PDF, 2.11 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1001718", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1001718/53c640"},

First elected in 2011, Buttigieg left a successful business career to move back to his hometown, previously tagged by Newsweek as a \u201cdying city,\u201d because the industrial Midwest beckoned as a challenge to the McKinsey-trained Harvard graduate. Whether meeting with city residents on middle-school basketball courts, reclaiming abandoned houses, confronting gun violence, or attracting high-tech industry, Buttigieg has transformed South Bend into a shining model of urban reinvention.\n\r\nWhile Washington reels with scandal, Shortest Way Home interweaves two once-unthinkable success stories: that of an Afghanistan veteran who came out and found love and acceptance, all while in office, and that of a Rust Belt city so thoroughly transformed that it shatters the way we view America\u2019s so-called flyover country.\n\r\n29 black and white photographs\n\r\n-\n\r\nPete Buttigieg, born in Indiana in 1982, is currently serving his second term as mayor of South Bend.

He was one of the last to leave the bunker and was responsible for guarding the door while Hitler killed himself. During his years of service, Linge was responsible for all aspects of Hitler\u2019s household and was constantly by his side.\n\r\nHere, Linge recounts the daily routine in Hitler\u2019s household: his eating habits, his foibles, his preferences, his sense of humor, and his private life with Eva Braun. After the war Linge said in an interview, \u201cIt was easier for him to sign a death warrant for an officer on the front than to swallow bad news about the health of his dog.\u201d Linge also charts the changes in Hitler\u2019s character during their time together and his fading health during the last years of the war. During his last days, Hitler\u2019s right eye began to hurt intensely and Linge was responsible for administering cocaine drops to kill the pain. In a number of instances\u2014such as with the Stauffenberg bomb plot of July 1944\u2014Linge gives an excellent eyewitness account of events. He also gives thumbnail profiles of the prominent members of Hitler\u2019s \u201ccourt\": Hess, Speer, Bormann and Ribbentrop amongst them.\n\r\nThough Linge held an SS rank, he claims not to have been a Nazi Party member. His profile of one of history\u2019s worst demons is not blindly uncritical, but it is nonetheless affectionate. The Hitler that emerges is a multi-faceted individual: unpredictable and demanding, but not of an otherwise unpleasant nature.\n\n\n\r\n=======\r\nREVIEW:\n\r\nExcellent story from the perspective of Hitler's valet; thus much of the material does not concern grand political strategies, but quotidian details such as Hitler's daily habits and health concerns as well as the author's personal feelings about many of the people constantly around Hitler (some of whom were in working capacities similar to the author himself, such as Hitler's physician[s], but also such figures as Himmler, Goebbels, G\u00f6ring, Bormann and others; in regards to the latter the author provides interesting details on many of their personalities, the rivalries between one another, and the feelings of the headquarters \"underlings\" such as himself [Hess was beloved, while Bormann was despised, for example]).\n\r\nThose looking for a work to either demonize or exculpate Hitler will be disappointed. There are numerous details and stories which serve to humanize Hitler, however, none of them are told in such a way that could be characterized as revisionist in the negative sense. (Things such as Hitler in his nightshirt changing a lightbulb by himself in his bedroom, or his problems with flatulence during the last years of his life.) Having said that the work does serve to humanize Hitler implicitly, although personally I feel that that is long overdue (Hess and especially Goebbels are also presented in a more positive light than is usually the case, while Bormann, G\u00f6ring and the entire military leadership are seen as more flawed.)\n\r\nShone new light (for me) on certain events such as Rommel's suicide (the author thinks it was ordered by Bormann because of an old grudge from the Polish campaign) and Hess's flight to Scotland (the author thinks Hitler knew about it), as well as new events (for me) such as Hitler's effort to sound out peace terms from the West in 1944/5. Also includes periodic passages about the author's years-long interrogation (including torture) at the hands of the Soviets after being captured fleeing the F\u00fchrerbunker.\n\r\nIncludes much discussion about the political power struggles that went on around Hitler, and how these affected domestic and foreign policies--there is much here to inform histories which all too often address events without taking into account the personal turf battles that take place in every government bureaucracy, fascist or otherwise.\n\r\nThere are periodic notes from the translator(?) about how other personal accounts from people at Hitler's headquarters differ from those presented here, but this is to be expected on a subject this volatile, with so many people having such a vested interest in being presented a certain way (along with the passage of time, and differing perceptions, of course). Having said that I found the author to be highly credible, and while I'm sure he has his blind spots, I think his story will be a valuable addition to histories of the time.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Frontline Books", "language": "english", "pages": "240", "ISBN10": "1626363269", "ISBN13": "9781626363267", "file": "EPUB, 412 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2475117/c1657d"},

It's a tough read, but definitely a worthwhile one, and the author's personality and strength shine through on every page. Covering the years from 1975 to 1979, the story moves from the deaths of multiple family members to the forced separation of the survivors, leading ultimately to the reuniting of much of the family, followed by marriages and immigrations. The brutality seems unending--beatings, starvation, attempted rape, mental cruelty--and yet the narrator (a young girl) never stops fighting for escape and survival. Sad and courageous, her life and the lives of her young siblings provide quite a powerful example of how war can so deeply affect children--especially a war in which they are trained to be an integral part of the armed forces. For anyone interested in Cambodia's recent history, this book shares a valuable personal view of events. *--Jill Lightner*   From Publishers Weekly  In 1975, Ung, now the national spokesperson for the Campaign for a Landmine-Free World, was the five-year-old child of a large, affluent family living in Phnom Penh, the cosmopolitan Cambodian capital. As extraordinarily well-educated Chinese-Cambodians, with the father a government agent, her family was in great danger when the Khmer Rouge took over the country and throughout Pol Pot's barbaric regime. Her parents' strength and her father's knowledge of Khmer Rouge ideology enabled the family to survive together for a while, posing as illiterate peasants, moving first between villages, and then from one work camp to another. The father was honest with the children, explaining dangers and how to avoid them, and this, along with clear sight, intelligence and the pragmatism of a young child, helped Ung to survive the war. Her restrained, unsentimental account of the four years she spent surviving the regime before escaping with a brother to Thailand and eventually the United States is astonishing--not just because of the tragedies, but also because of the immense love for her family that Ung holds onto, no matter how she is brutalized. She describes the physical devastation she is surrounded by but always returns to her memories and hopes for those she loves. Her joyful memories of life in Phnom Penh are close even as she is being trained as a child soldier, and as, one after another, both parents and two of her six siblings are murdered in the camps. Skillfully constructed, this account also stands as an eyewitness history of the period, because as a child Ung was so aware of her surroundings, and because as an adult writer she adds details to clarify the family's moves and separations. Twenty-five years after the rise of the Khmer Rouge, this powerful account is a triumph. 8 pages b&w photos.

When it first appeared in 1982, Christian Science Monitor called it \"an extraordinary biography of an extraordinary man,\" and Timothy Ferris, in The New York Times Book Review, said it was \"the biography of Einstein he himself would have liked best,\" adding that \"it is a work against which future scientific biographies will be measured.\" As a respected physicist himself, Pais was the first biographer to give Einstein's thinking its full due, yet despite the occasional high level of science needed to discuss Einstein's ideas, it was the winner of the 1983 American Book Award for Science.         Now Pais turns to Niels Bohr, to illuminate the life and thought of another giant of 20th-century physics. Bohr was the first to understand how atoms were put together.  He played a major role in shaping the theory of the atomic nucleus, he decoded the atomic spectrum of hydrogen, an achievement which marks him as the founder of the quantum dynamics of atoms, and his concept of complementarity (which provides the philosophical underpinning for quantum theory) qualifies him as one of the twentieth century's greatest philosophers. Pais covers all of these achievements with sophistication and clarity, but he also reveals the many other facets of the man. Perhaps most important, he shows that Bohr was not only a great scientist, but also a great nurturer of young scientific talent, acting as father figure extraordinaire for several generations of  physicists. Bohr's Institute of Theoretical Physics, which he founded in Copenhagen and for which he tirelessly raised funds, was the world's leading center for physics all through the 1920s and 1930s, the birthplace of Heisenberg's papers on the uncertainty relations, Dirac's first paper on quantum electrodynamics, and other pivotal works. And Pais reveals as well the personal side of Bohr, the avid reader and crossword puzzle solver (Bohr loved Icelandic sagas, Goethe and Schiller, Dickens and Mark Twain--while studying in England early in his career, he improved his English by reading The Pickwick Papers with a dictionary to one side); his aid to Jews and other refugees in the 1930s and during the war; the tragic loss of his son Christian (who died in a sailing accident right before Bohr's eyes); and his attempts during and after the war to promote openness between East and West, meeting with both Roosevelt and Churchill (the former was quite courteous, the latter lectured Bohr like a schoolboy).       Niels Bohr's Times, is a marvelous biography that captures the essence of one of the best-loved figures of this century", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "1994", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "604 / 598", "ISBN10": "0198520484", "ISBN13": "9780198520481", "file": "PDF, 10.65 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1309427", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1309427/e9e4d9"},

Appointed by the then Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, to be chief economic adviser (CEA) to the Government of India, Basu -- a theorist, with special interest in development economics, and a professor of economics at Cornell University -- discovered the complexity of applying economic models to the real world. Effective policymaking, Basu learned, integrates technical knowledge with political awareness. In this book, Basu describes the art of economic policymaking, viewed through the lens of his two and a half years as CEA.Basu writes from a unique perspective -- neither that of the career bureaucrat nor that of the traditional researcher. Plunged into the deal-making, non-hypothetical world of policymaking, Basu suffers from a kind of culture shock and views himself at first as an anthropologist or scientist, gathering observations of unfamiliar phenomena. He addresses topics that range from the macroeconomic -- fiscal and monetary policies -- to the granular -- designing grain auctions and policies to assure everyone has access to basic food. Basu writes about globalization and India's period of unprecedented growth, and he reports that at a dinner hosted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, President Obama joked to him, \"You should give this guy some tips\" -- \"this guy\" being Timothy Geithner. Basu describes the mixed success of India's anti-poverty programs and the problems of corruption, and considers the social norms and institutions necessary for economic development. India is, Basu argues, at an economics crossroad.

Why the drive to attract immigrants despite Singaporeans' discomfiture? Lee, fielding these and many other questions in the book and on DVD, is combative, thought-provoking and controversial.

Now, in this fast-paced, colorful biography, Gale E. Christianson paints an engaging portrait of Newton and the times in which he lived.  We follow Newton from his childhood in rural England to his student days at Cambridge, where he devoured the works of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, and taught himself mathematics. There ensued two miraculous years at home in Woolsthorpe Manor, where he fled when plague threatened Cambridge, a remarkably fertile period when Newton formulated his theory of gravity, a new theory of light, and calculus--all by his twenty-fourth birthday. Christianson describes Newton's creation of the first working model of the reflecting telescope, which brought him to the attention of the Royal Society, and he illuminates the eighteen months of intense labor that resulted in his Principia, arguably the most important scientific work ever published. The book sheds light on Newton's later life as master of the mint in London, where he managed to convict and hang the arch criminal William Chaloner (a remarkable turn for a once reclusive scholar), and his presidency of the Royal Society, which he turned from a dilettante's club into an eminent scientific organization. Christianson also explores Newton's less savory side, including his long, bitter feud with Robert Hooke and the underhanded way that Newton established his priority in the invention of calculus and tarnished Liebniz's reputation.  Newton was an authentic genius with all too human faults. This book captures both sides of this truly extraordinary man.  A volume in Oxford's Lives and Legacies series. Brief, erudite, and inviting, the exciting new Lives and Legacies series offers a fresh look at some of the greatest minds in the humanities and sciences.

In the late 1940s, George Kennan wrote two documents, the \"Long  Telegram\" and the \"X Article,\" which set forward the strategy of  containment that would define U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union for  the next four decades. This achievement alone would qualify him as the  most influential American diplomat of the Cold War era. But he was also  an architect of the Marshall Plan, a prizewinning historian, and would  become one of the most outspoken critics of American diplomacy,  politics, and culture during the last half of the twentieth century.  Now the full scope of Kennan's long life and vast influence is revealed  by one of today's most important Cold War scholars.Yale historian John Lewis Gaddis began this magisterial history  almost thirty years ago, interviewing Kennan frequently and gaining  complete access to his voluminous diaries and other personal papers. So  frank and detailed were these materials that Kennan and Gaddis agreed  that the book would not appear until after Kennan's death. It was well  worth the wait: the journals give this book a breathtaking candor and  intimacy that match its century-long sweep.We see Kennan's insecurity as a Midwesterner among elites at  Princeton, his budding dissatisfaction with authority and the status  quo, his struggles with depression, his gift for satire, and his sharp  insights on the policies and people he encountered. Kennan turned these  sharp analytical gifts upon himself, even to the point of regularly  recording dreams. The result is a remarkably revealing view of how this  greatest of Cold War strategists came to doubt his strategy and always  doubted himself.This is a landmark work of history and biography that reveals the  vast influence and rich inner landscape of a life that both mirrored  and shaped the century it spanned.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2011", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "Penguin Press HC, The", "language": "english", "pages": "800", "ISBN10": "1594203121", "ISBN13": "9781594203121", "file": "EPUB, 2.90 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1213599/64172b"},

FDR and later Truman wanted to use the atomic bomb as a diplomatic lever against the Soviet Union. Both of these presidents would only share the secret of the bomb with the Soviets if they complied with the American demands on letting the Eastern European countries pursue their own destiny. The Russians on the other hand wanted to develop their own bomb not because they thought it would be decisive but because it was viewed as propaganda tool against the Soviets which demonstrated Western strength. In the book the authors make the case that dropping the first atmomic bomb on Hiroshima was necessary but the second on Nagasaki was not and was mainly a demonstration to scare the Russians into accepting American demands. The authors also stated that the Baruch Plan was used as propaganda ploy by both sides with the Americans wanting the Soviets to reject the plan while the Soviets used it to display American nuclear blackmail. Also spying made the problem worse becuase it stiffened US resolve to not give up nuclear secrets to an international body for fear that the Soviets were developing their own nuclear weapon. When the  Soviets finally developed their bomb, the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union began. The only weakness of the book is that the authors have ignored how Germany and the division of that country was probably a greater factor in starting the Cold War. Also from reading the recent work by Hasegawa it appears that the dropping of the atomic bomb was not really necessary unlike what the authors have stated in this book. Nevertheless this is a interesting book about how the arms race started.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2008", "publisher": "Yale University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "230", "ISBN10": "0300110286", "ISBN13": "9780300142655", "file": "PDF, 759 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/689905", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/689905/601991"},

Her family, belonging to the Mala caste, was educated in Warangal and Madras by Canadian missionaries in the 1930s, making it possible for Gidla to attend elite schools and move to America at the age of twenty-six. It was only then that she saw how extraordinary - and yet how typical - her family history truly was. Determined to uncover that history, and understand the social and political forces that made it possible, she traveled back to India to record the testimonies of her mother, her uncles, and their friends. In Ants Among Elephants, she tells their story. Gidla's mother, Manjula, and uncles Satyam and Carey were born in the last days of British rule. They grew up in a world marked by poverty and injustice, but also full of possibility. In the slums of Elwin Peta in Kakinada, where they lived, everyone had a political bent; and rallies, agitations, and arrests were commonplace. The Independence movement offered promises of freedom from foreign rule, from want, and from social oppression. Yet, for untouchables and other poor and working people, little changed. Satyam, the eldest, switched allegiance to the Communist Party. Gidla recounts his incredible transformation from student and labor organizer to famous poet and co-founder of the People's War Group, the most notorious and successful Naxalite party. Gidla also charts her mother's battles with caste and women's oppression. Page by page, she takes us into a complicated, close-knit family as they desperately strive for a decent life and a more just society.

And no scholar of contemporary East Asian history and culture is better qualified than Ezra Vogel to disentangle the many contradictions embodied in the life and legacy of China\u2019s boldest strategist.Once described by Mao Zedong as a \u201cneedle inside a ball of cotton,\u201d Deng was the pragmatic yet disciplined driving force behind China\u2019s radical transformation in the late twentieth century. He confronted the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution, dissolved Mao\u2019s cult of personality, and loosened the economic and social policies that had stunted China\u2019s growth. Obsessed with modernization and technology, Deng opened trade relations with the West, which lifted hundreds of millions of his countrymen out of poverty. Yet at the same time he answered to his authoritarian roots, most notably when he ordered the crackdown in June 1989 at Tiananmen Square.Deng\u2019s youthful commitment to the Communist Party was cemented in Paris in the early 1920s, among a group of Chinese student-workers that also included Zhou Enlai. Deng returned home in 1927 to join the Chinese Revolution on the ground floor. In the fifty years of his tumultuous rise to power, he endured accusations, purges, and even exile before becoming China\u2019s preeminent leader from 1978 to 1989 and again in 1992.

In Algeria, Fanon came into contact with the Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale, whose ruthless struggle for independence was met with exceptional violence from the French forces. He identified closely with the liberation movement, and his political sympathies eventually forced him out the country, whereupon he became a propagandist and ambassador for the FLN, as well as a seminal anticolonial theorist. David Macey\u2019s eloquent life of Fanon provides a comprehensive account of a complex individual\u2019s personal, intellectual and political development.

Also recorded here are his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Burbank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other celebrated spiritual personalities of East and West.\n\r\nThe author clearly explains the subtle but definite laws behind both the ordinary events of everyday life and the extraordinary events commonly termed miracles.

Elizabeth I loved the Earl of Leicester, but did she conspire to murder his wife? She called herself the Virgin Queen, but how chaste was she through dozens of liaisons? She never married--was her choice to remain single tied to the chilling fate of her mother, Anne Boleyn?

Undermined by a ruling elite hungry for money and power, Pakistan now stands alone as the only Islamic country with a nuclear bomb, yet unable to protect its people from the carnage of regular bombings at home. How did it reach this flashpoint of instability and injustice with such potentially catastrophic results for the whole world?Recounting his country's history through the prism of his own memories, Imran Khan starts from its foundation, ripped out of the dying British Raj. He guides us through and comments on subsequent historical developments which shook the Muslim world -- the wars with India in 1965 and 1971, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Societ invasion of Afghanistan, the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- to the current controversial and intractable war in Afghanistan. Throughout we see these events viewed not only through the eyes of Westerners, but through those of ordinary Pakistanis.Drawing on the experiences of his own family and his wide travels within his homeland, Pakistan: A Personal History provides a unique insider's view of a country unfamiliar to a western audience. Woven into this history we see how Imran Khan's personal life -- his happy childhood in Lahore, his Oxford education, his extraordinary cricketing career, his playboy years and marriage to Jemima Goldsmith, his mother's influence and that of his Islamic faith -- inform both the historical narrative and his current philanthropic and political activities. It is at once absorbing and insightful, casting fresh light upon a country whose culture he believes is largely misunderstood by the West.From the Trade Paperback edition.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Bantam Press", "language": "english", "pages": "400 / 257", "ISBN10": "0593067754", "ISBN13": "9780593067758", "file": "PDF, 8.38 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2359278", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2359278/1e0d1f"},

In four major publications, he fashioned a philosophical system that accommodated the needs of these new sciences, thereby earning the unrelenting hostility of both Catholic and Calvinist theologians, who relied on the scholastic philosophy that Descartes hoped to replace. His contemporaries claimed that his proofs of God's existence, in the Meditations, were so unsuccessful that he must have been a cryptic atheist, and that his discussion of skepticism served merely to fan the flames of libertinism. Although Descartes died in Stockholm in obscurity, he soon became one of the most famous philosophers of the seventeenth century, a status that he continues to enjoy today.  This English-language biography addresses the complete range of Descartes' interests in theology, philosophy, and the sciences, and traces his intellectual development throughout his entire career.    Desmond M. Clarke is Professor of Philosophy at University College Cork, Ireland, where he previously served as Dean of Arts and Vice-President. He is author of a number of books on Descartes and the seventeenth century, including Descartes' Philosophy of Science (1982), Occult Powers & Hypotheses (1989) and Descartes' Theory of Mind (1993).

The culmination of a lifetime's work, Segev's book casts the history of Israel and its founder in a bracing new light. Using large amounts of previously unrevealed archival material, Segev demonstrates Ben-Gurion's power, skills, and achievements, as well as his limitations, weaknesses, and failures. Segev's probing account reveals for the first time Ben-Gurion's secret negotiations with the British on the eve of Israel's independence, his willingness to countenance the forced transfer of Arab neighbors, his relative indifference to the status of Jerusalem and Israel's nuclear program, and his occasional \"nutty moments\"--from UFO sightings to a plan for Israel to acquire territory in South America. Segev also shows that Ben-Gurion first heard about the Holocaust from a Palestinian Arab acquaintance, and reveals Ben-Gurion's tempestuous private life, including the testimony of four longtime lovers.Many admired Ben-Gurion in his day, and many now miss his vision and inspiration, his boldness and integrity. Others have vilified him as an aggressive, divisive, dour, and often capricious politician. But only a few have really grasped the most intimate and guarded aspects of his complex character, the man behind the myth. As in his seven previous books on Israel and the Holocaust, which have been translated into fourteen languages, Segev again offers a vibrant page-turner with unexpected discoveries and original insights.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2019", "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "language": "english", "pages": "816", "ISBN10": "0374112649", "ISBN13": "9780374112646", "file": "EPUB, 16.95 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5249456/5dd986"},

The town that started as a small military site exploded with the coming of the railroad, cattle drives, eager miners, settlers, and various entrepreneurs passing through to populate the expanding West. Before long, Dodge City's streets were lined with saloons and brothels and its populace was thick with gunmen, horse thieves, and desperadoes of every sort. By the 1870s, Dodge City was known as the most violent and turbulent town in the West. Enter Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. Young and largely self-trained men, the lawmen led the effort that established frontier justice and the rule of law in the American West, and did it in the wickedest place in the United States.

In the second half of the seventeenth century, he extended France's frontiers into the Netherlands and Germany, and established colonies in America, Africa and India. Louisiana, which once occupied a third of the territory of the present-day United States, is named after him.\n\r\nLouis was also one of the greatest patrons of European history - Moli\u00e8re, Racine, Lully, Le Brun, le N\u00f4tre all worked for him. The stupendous palace he built at Versailles, and its satellites at Marly and Trianon, became the envy of monarchs all over Europe, frequently imitated but never surpassed. In all his palaces, Louis encouraged dancing, hunting, music and gambling. He loved conversation, especially with women: the power of women in Louis's life and reign is a particular theme of this book.\n\r\nLouis was obsessed by the details of government, and travelled extensively around his kingdom, but often his choices for ministers and generals proved disastrous. After the death of his very able minister Colbert, the extraordinary cost of building palaces and waging continuous wars devastated French finances and helped set France on the path to revolution. In 1685, his decision to revoke toleration for Protestants damaged his country, and alienated Protestant Europe and at the end of his life, his forces were persistently defeated by the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. Nevertheless, by his death, he had helped make his grandson king of Spain, where his descendants still reign, and France had taken essentially the shape it has today.\n\r\nPhilip Mansel's King of the World is much the most comprehensive and up-to-date biography of this hypnotic, flawed figure in English. It draws on all the latest research in France, Britain and America and pays special attention to the culture of the court, on which Mansel is an acknowledged expert.

After returning home he became a hustler and hit man, working for legendary crime boss Russell Bufalino. Eventually he would rise to a position of such prominence that in a RICO suit then-U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani would name him as one of only two non-Italians on a list of 26 top mob figures.When Bufalino ordered Sheeran to kill Hoffa, he did the deed, knowing that if he had refused he would have been killed himself.Sheeran's important and fascinating story includes new information on other famous murders including those of Joey Gallo and JFK, and provides rare insight to a chapter in American history.

Yet modern India, most strikingly in its decision to join the nuclear arms race, seems to have abandoned much of his nonviolent vision. Inspired by recent events in India, Stanley Wolpert offers this subtle and profound biography of India's \"Great Soul.\"Wolpert compellingly chronicles the life of Mahatma Gandhi from his early days as a child of privilege to his humble rise to power and his assassination at the hands of a man of his own faith. This trajectory, like that of Christ, was the result of Gandhi's passion: his conscious courting of suffering as the means to reach divine truth. From his early campaigns to stop discrimination in South Africa to his leadership of a people's revolution to end the British imperial domination of India, Gandhi emerges as a man of inner conflicts obscured by his political genius and moral vision. Influenced early on by nonviolent teachings in Hinduism, Jainism, Christianity, and Buddhism, he came to insist on the primacy of love for one's adversary in any conflict as the invincible power for change. His unyielding opposition to intolerance and oppression would inspire India like no leader since the Buddha--creating a legacy that would encourage Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela, and other global leaders to demand a better world through peaceful civil disobedience.By boldly considering Gandhi the man, rather than the living god depicted by his disciples, Wolpert provides an unprecedented representation of Gandhi's personality and the profound complexities that compelled his actions and brought freedom to India.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2002", "language": "english", "pages": "336 / 337", "ISBN10": "019515634X", "ISBN13": "9781423722496", "file": "PDF, 20.32 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/852631", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/852631/d0ee0a"},

He draws the turbulence of the post-war era during which the Shah survived assassination attempts and coup plots to build a modern, pro-Western state and launch Iran onto the world stage as one of the world's top five powers. Readers get the story of the Shah's political career alongside the story of his courtship and marriage to Farah Diba, who became a power in her own right, the beloved family they created, and an exclusive look at life inside the palace during the Iranian Revolution. Cooper's investigative account ultimately delivers the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty through the eyes of those who were there: leading Iranian revolutionaries; President Jimmy Carter and White House officials; US Ambassador William Sullivan and his staff in the American embassy in Tehran; American families caught up in the drama; even Empress Farah herself, and the rest of the Iranian Imperial family.

He soon became interested in science and astronomy, and began penning stories, poetry, and essays in great profusion, publishing them himself when no other market was available. The advent of Weird Tales in 1923 gave him a small outlet for his work, and he attracted a large number of followers, with whom he exchanged literally tens of thousands of letters, many of them quite lengthy. A number of these young correspondents eventually became professional writers and editors themselves. Lovecraft\u2019s fame began spreading beyond fandom with the publication of his first significant collection, The Outsider and Others, in 1939, two years after his untimely death.\n\nS. T.

I. M. Pei, Paul Rudolph, Anni Albers, Philip Johnson, Fumihiko Maki: countless masters were once disciples at the Bauhaus in Berlin and at Harvard. Between 1910 and 1930, Gropius was at the center of European modernism and avant-garde society glamor, only to be exiled to the antimodernist United Kingdom during the Nazi years. Later, under the democratizing influence of American universities, Gropius became an advocate of public art and cemented a starring role in twentieth-century architecture and design.Fiona MacCarthy challenges the image of Gropius as a doctrinaire architectural rationalist, bringing out the visionary philosophy and courage that carried him through a politically hostile age. Pilloried by Tom Wolfe as inventor of the monolithic high-rise, Gropius is better remembered as inventor of a form of art education that influenced schools worldwide. He viewed argument as intrinsic to creativity. Unusually for one in his position, Gropius encouraged women's artistic endeavors and sought equal romantic partners. Though a traveler in elite circles, he objected to the cloistering of beauty as \"a special privilege for the aesthetically initiated.\"Gropiusoffers a poignant and personal story--and a fascinating reexamination of the urges that drove European and American modernism.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2019", "publisher": "Belknap Press", "language": "english", "pages": "560 / 576", "ISBN10": "0674737857", "ISBN13": "9780674737853", "file": "PDF, 454.44 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5010057", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5010057/f843b6"},

It not only cut short the lives of two of the country's most\r\n brilliant political leaders, but also inaugurated a series of further \r\npolitical assassinations designed to snuff out the revolutionary flame \r\nand, ultimately, pave the way for the ultra-reactionary forces that \r\nwould take power in 1933.

Wilson helped usher in the cultural revolution of the 1960s with his landmark work, The Outsider, published in 1956. The Outsider was an intelligent, meticulous, and unprecedented study of nonconformity in all facets of life. Wilson, finally, became a prolific and unparalleled historian of the occult, providing a generation of readers with a responsible and scholarly entry point to a world of mysteries. Now, acclaimed historian Gary Lachman, a friend of Wilson and a scholar of his work, provides an extraordinary and delightful biography that delves into the life, thought, and evolution of one of the greatest intellectual rebels and underrated visionaries of the twentieth century.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2016", "publisher": "TarcherPerigee", "language": "english", "pages": "416", "ISBN10": "0399173080", "ISBN13": "9780399173080", "file": "EPUB, 909 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3514869/215242"},

Thus began the reputation that made him a marked man to every gunslinger in the Wild West.James Butler Hickock was known across the frontier as a soldier, Union spy, scout, lawman, gunfighter, gambler, showman, and actor. He crossed paths with General Custer and Buffalo Bill Cody, as well as Ben Thompson and other young toughs gunning for the sheriff with the quickest draw west of the Mississippi.Wild Bill also fell in love--multiple times--before marrying the true love of his life, Agnes Lake, the impresario of a traveling circus. He would be buried however, next to fabled frontierswoman Calamity Jane.Even before his death, Wild Bill became a legend, with fiction sometimes supplanting fact in the stories that surfaced. Once, in a bar in Nebraska, he was confronted by four men, three of whom he killed in the ensuing gunfight. A famousHarper's Magazinearticle credited Hickok with slaying 10 men that day; by the 1870s, his career-long kill count was up to 100.The legend of Wild Bill has only grown since his death in 1876, when cowardly Jack McCall famously put a bullet through the back of his head during a card game.

He likes to play roles. The images that his public relations team has orchestrated range from big game hunter to scuba diver to biker, even night club crooner. It is reminiscent of the British cartoon character Mr. Benn. Observers have variously said, he has no face, no substance, no soul; he is \"the man from nowhere\" \u2014a nobody, yet a man who can appear to be anybody. Of course, Putin is not a \"nobody\"; he only wants the world to see him that way, and he has gone to extraordinary lengths throughout his life to conceal who he really is.In this book, Russian experts Fiona Hill and Clifford Gaddy answer the question, \"Who is Mr. Putin?\" Drawing on many sources, including their own personal encounters with him, they argue that there are, in fact, several \"real Putins.\" His outlook has been shaped by many influences \u2014a combination of archetypical Russian mentality, a very close reading of Russian history and literature, his own early life, his KGB training, his time in East Germany, his experiences in St. Petersburg in the 1990s, his early days behind the scenes in Moscow, and his time at the helm of the Russian state. Understanding his multidimensional nature is and should be important for U.S. and other policymakers trying to decide how to approach and interact with him.While uncovering the many real identities of Mr. Putin, the authors concentrate on five essential ones: Putin the Statist, Putin the Survivalist, Putin the Outsider, Putin the Free Marketeer, and Putin the Case Officer. For each of these identities, they explain what it is, why it is important for understanding Putin, and trace its roots and evolution. Finally, they examine the nature of the personalized system that Putin has built up and why it can be understood as a logical result of his personality. He has an idealized view of himself as CEO of \"Russia, Inc.\" In reality, his leadership style is more like that of the don of a mafia family. The system is personalized, private, informal; enforcement is not by positive incentives but by threats. Putin the CEO has not been the executive of a transparent public corporation; he's been one who operated in the closed board room of a privately held corporation, feeling no need to disclose the shareholders or motivate any decisions. And now his corporation is in crisis. The public is demanding that Putin the CEO be held accountable for its failings.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Brookings Institution Press", "language": "english", "pages": "400 / 410", "ISBN10": "0815723768", "ISBN13": "9780815723769", "file": "PDF, 3.71 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5156441", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5156441/2c6f58"},

Richard Billows\u2019 dynamic and fast paced narrative offers an imaginative recounting of actions and events, providing the ideal introduction to Julius Caesar for general readers and students of classics and ancient history.     The book is not just a biography of Caesar, but an historical account and explanation of the decline and fall of the Roman Republican governing system, in which Caesar played a crucial part. To understand Caesar\u2019s life and role, it is necessary to grasp the political, social and economic problems Rome was grappling with, and the deep divisions within Roman society that came from them. Caesar has been seen variously as a mere opportunist, a power-hungry autocrat, an arrogant aristocrat disdaining rivals, a traditional Roman noble politician who stumbled into civil war and autocracy thanks to being misunderstood by his rivals, and even as the ideal man and pattern of all virtues. Richard A. Billows argues that such portrayals fail to consider the universal testimony of our ancient sources that Roman political life was divided in Caesar\u2019s time into two great political tendencies, called \"optimates\" and \"populares\" in the sources, of which Caesar came to be the leader of one: the \"popularis\" faction.    Billows suggests that it is only when we see Caesar as the leader of a great political and social movement, that had been struggling with its rival movement for decades and had been several times violently repressed in the course of that struggle, that we can understand how and why Caesar came to fight and win a civil war, and bring the traditional governing system of Rome to an end.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2009", "publisher": "Routledge", "language": "english", "pages": "335", "ISBN10": "0203412761", "ISBN13": "9780203412763", "file": "PDF, 1.83 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/835502", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/835502/af9792"},

Rockefeller, Sr.--history's first billionaire and the patriarch of America's most famous dynasty--is an icon whose true nature has eluded three generations of historians. Now Ron Chernow, the National Book Award-winning biographer of the Morgan and Warburg banking families, gives us a history of the mogul \"etched with uncommon objectivity and literary grace . . . as detailed, balanced, and psychologically insightful a portrait of the tycoon as we may ever have\" (Kirkus Reviews). Titan is the first full-length biography based on unrestricted access to Rockefeller's exceptionally rich trove of papers. A landmark publication full of startling revelations, the book will indelibly alter our image of this most enigmatic capitalist.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Born the son of a flamboyant, bigamous snake-oil salesman and a pious, straitlaced mother, Rockefeller rose from rustic origins to become the world's richest man by creating America's most powerful and feared monopoly, Standard Oil. Branded \"the Octopus\" by legions of muckrakers, the trust refined and marketed nearly 90 percent of the oil produced in America.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockefeller was likely the most controversial businessman in our nation's history. Critics charged that his empire was built on unscrupulous tactics: grand-scale collusion with the railroads, predatory pricing, industrial espionage, and wholesale bribery of political officials. The titan spent more than thirty years dodging investigations until Teddy Roosevelt and his trustbusters embarked on a marathon crusade to bring Standard Oil to bay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While providing abundant new evidence of Rockefeller's misdeeds, Chernow discards the stereotype of the cold-blooded monster to sketch an unforgettably human portrait of a quirky, eccentric original. A devout Baptist and temperance advocate, Rockefeller gave money more generously--his chosen philanthropies included the Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Chicago, and what is today Rockefeller University--than anyone before him. Titan presents a finely nuanced portrait of a fascinating, complex man, synthesizing his public and private lives and disclosing numerous family scandals, tragedies, and misfortunes that have never before come to light.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0John D. Rockefeller's story captures a pivotal moment in American history, documenting the dramatic post-Civil War shift from small business to the rise of giant corporations that irrevocably transformed the nation. With cameos by Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst, Jay Gould, William Vanderbilt, Ida Tarbell, Andrew Carnegie, Carl Jung, J. Pierpont Morgan, William James, Henry Clay Frick, Mark Twain, and Will Rogers, Titan turns Rockefeller's life into a vivid tapestry of American society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is Ron Chernow's signal triumph that he narrates this monumental saga with all the sweep, drama, and insight that this giant subject deserves.From the Hardcover edition.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2004", "edition": "2nd", "publisher": "Vintage", "language": "english", "pages": "832", "ISBN10": "1400077303", "ISBN13": "9781400077304", "file": "MOBI , 10.54 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1163589/0a82a8"},

The female pharaohs Hatshepsut and Tawosret, the sun queens Tiy and Nefertiti, the seductive Nefertari and Cleopatra: many of Egypt's queens have left an indelible mark on their country's history.And what of Egypt's lesser queens, the numerous wives and daughters maintained in pampered seclusion in the harem palaces? These women are generally forgotten, their graves lost in the desert sands. But the anonymous ladies occasionally stepped from the security of the harem to influence the royal succession, and their stories too are told. 273 illustrations, 150 in color", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2006", "edition": "Ill", "publisher": "Thames & Hudson", "language": "english", "pages": "226", "ISBN13": "9780500051450", "file": "PDF, 221.81 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/808631", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/808631/aedde0"},

His dream was at times characterized as a benevolent interest in the brotherhood of man, sometimes as a brute interest in the exercise of power. Green, a Cambridge-trained classicist who is also a novelist, portrays Alexander as both a complex personality and a single-minded general, a man capable of such diverse expediencies as patricide or the massacre of civilians. Green describes his Alexander as \"not only the most brilliant (and ambitious) field commander in history, but also supremely indifferent to all those administrative excellences and idealistic yearnings foisted upon him by later generations, especially those who found the conqueror, tout court, a little hard upon their liberal sensibilities.\"This biography begins not with one of the universally known incidents of Alexander's life, but with an account of his father, Philip of Macedonia, whose many-territoried empire was the first on the continent of Europe to have an effectively centralized government and military. What Philip and Macedonia had to offer, Alexander made his own, but Philip and Macedonia also made Alexander form an important context for understanding Alexander himself. Yet his origins and training do not fully explain the man. After he was named hegemon of the Hellenic League, many philosophers came to congratulate Alexander, but one was conspicuous by his absence: Diogenes the Cynic, an ascetic who lived in a clay tub. Piqued and curious, Alexander himself visited the philosopher, who, when asked if there was anything Alexander could do for him, made the famous reply, \"Don't stand between me and the sun.\" Alexander's courtiers jeered, but Alexander silenced them: \"If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.\" This remark was as unexpected in Alexander as it would be in a modern leader.For the general reader, the book, redolent with gritty details and fully aware of Alexander's darker side, offers a gripping tale of Alexander's career.

Karl begins with Mao\u2019s early life in a small village in Hunan province, documenting his relationships with his parents, passion for education, and political awakening during the fall of the Qing dynasty in late 1911. She traces his transition from liberal to Communist over the course of the next decade, his early critiques of the subjugation of women, and the gathering force of the May 4th movement for reform and radical change. Describing Mao\u2019s rise to power, she delves into the dynamics of Communist organizing in an overwhelmingly agrarian society, and Mao\u2019s confrontations with Chiang Kaishek and other nationalist conservatives. She also considers his marriages and romantic liaisons and their relation to Mao as the revolutionary founder of Communism in China. After analyzing Mao\u2019s stormy tenure as chairman of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Karl concludes by examining his legacy in China from his death in 1976 through the Beijing Olympics in 2008.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Historical", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Duke University Press Books", "language": "english", "pages": "216 / 111", "ISBN10": "0822347954", "ISBN13": "9780822347958", "file": "PDF, 12.98 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1293016", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1293016/b1bb6f"},

His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.

His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals.

After rising through the ranks of the German army, Hermann Goering became Hitler\u2019s right hand man and was hand-picked to head the Luftwaffe, one of history\u2019s most feared fighting forces. As he rose in power, though, Goering became disillusioned and was eventually shunned from Hitler\u2019s inner circle. Alone at the end, he faced justice at the Nuremberg trials and was convicted of war crimes and crime against humanity. He committed suicide in prison before he could be hanged.

Ze analyseert steeds opnieuw wat ze ziet gebeuren, maar kan geen logische verklaring vinden voor de waanzin waar ze iedere dag mee te maken heeft. Daar stopt het verhaal echter niet. Het meisje groeit op tot een vrouw die niet kan accepteren dat ze zichzelf en haar leven niet begrijpt. Ze blijft net zo lang vechten en onderzoeken, totdat ze hier wel enige grip op krijgt. 'Uit de kluwen' laat zien hoe je uiteindelijk los kunt komen van ongezonde (familie-) patronen en de weg terug kunt vinden naar jezelf. Anne beschrijft de complexiteit van het leven, maar het gaat ook over moed, doorzetten, daadkracht en hoe kansen kunnen keren. Over tevoorschijn komen en de kern terugvinden waartoe je bedoeld bent. De auteur baseert zich op eigen authentieke dagboekfragmenten, op feiten uit haar (hulpverlenings-) dossiers, literatuur en theorie\u00ebn.

Wie is deze PvdA-politicus, en wat drijft hem? Lodewijk van Wilfred Scholten, winnaar van de Brusseprijs voor het Beste Journalistieke Boek van 2013, is een onthullend portret van een sto\u00efcijns optimist die ten val kwam, maar belooft terug te komen. Lodewijk Asscher was het grootste politieke talent binnen de PvdA, maar leed bij de verkiezingen van 2017 de grootste nederlaag ooit. Asscher besloot te blijven, hij wilde revanche. In de oppositie bloeide hij op en als lijsttrekker stond hij op scherp voor de verkiezingen van maart 2021. Toch ging het mis. Zijn rol in de toeslagenaffaire nekte hem en de gedroomde comeback werd een politiek drama. Journalist Wilfred Scholten volgde Asscher de afgelopen vier jaar bij zijn pogingen de sociaaldemocratie weer relevant te maken. Hij ontmoette een familieman, een debater en vakbekwaam parlementari\u00ebr, maar zag ook een politicus die op zoek was naar een achterban, naar aandacht en macht. Wie is deze politicus met joodse roots? Wat drijft hem? En waarom zag hij Mark Rutte als zijn ideale tegenstander?

This biography traces Elizabeth's youth in rural Knutsford, her married years in the tension-ridden city of Manchester and her wide network of friends in London, Europe and America. Standing as a figure caught up in the religious and political radicalism of nineteenth century Britain, the book looks at how Elizabeth observed, from her Manchester home, the brutal but transforming impact of industry, enjoying a social and family life, but distracted by her need to write down the truth of what she saw. In this widely acclaimed biography, Elizabeth Gaskell emerges as an artist of unrecognized complexity, shrewdly observing the political, religious and feminist arguments of nineteenth century Britain, with enjoyment, passion and wit. Jenny Uglow is the bestselling author of Nature's Engraver, which won the National Arts Writers Award, and A Gambling Man: Charles II and the Restoration, which was shortlisted for the 2010 Samuel Johnson Prize.

Reichl, with a highly developed knowledge and love of Asian cuisine from her years as a West Coast food critic, began to review the small simple establishments that abound in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Many loved it, the Establishment hated it, but her influence was significant. She brought a fresh writing style to her reviews and adopted a radical way of getting them. Amassing a wardrobe of wigs and costumes, she deliberately disguised herself so that she would not receive special treatment. As a result, she had a totally different dining experience as say, Miriam the Jewish mother than she did as Ruth Reichl the reviewer, and she wasn't afraid to write about it. The resulting reviews were hilarious and sobering, full of fascinating insights and delicious gossip.

Pop culture is the Pandora's Box of our lives. Racism, wealth, poverty, beauty, inclusion, exclusion, and hope -- all of these intractable and unavoidable features course through the media we consume. Examining pop culture's impact on her life, Nichole Perkins takes readers on a rollicking trip through the last twenty years of music, media and the internet from the perspective of one southern Black woman. She explores her experience with mental illness and how the TV series Frasier served as a crutch, how her role as mistress led her to certain internet message boards that prepared her for current day social media, and what it means to figure out desire and sexuality and Prince in a world where marriage is the only acceptable goal for women. Combining her sharp wit, stellar pop culture sensibility, and trademark spirited storytelling, Nichole boldly tackles the damage done to women, especially Black women, by society's failure to confront the myths and misogyny at its heart, and her efforts to stop the various cycles that limit confidence within herself. By using her own life and loves as a unique vantage point, Nichole humorously and powerfully illuminates how to take the best pop culture has to offer and discard the harmful bits, offering a mirror into our own lives.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Literary Biography", "year": "2021", "publisher": "Dial Books", "language": "english", "pages": "256", "ISBN10": "0593322819", "file": "EPUB, 1.60 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/17085669/db44b8"},

Much is known about the existence of this place, yet there has been little, if any documentation of the actual lives of the sex workers in the region: how they go about earning a living; the difficulties of their careers and lives; the problems they face; what makes them happy, etc. In his book Soofi conducted interviews and talked to them, and gathered data and beautiful, detailed photographs to make a poignant and touching tale of their actual lives, outside just their identity as prostitutes.Conducted as a series of open ended question based interviews, Nobody Can Love You More: Life In Delhi's Red Light District gives the reader an insight into the way the red light district in Delhi works and the ins and outs of the business, and also describes the day to day affairs and lives of these sex workers, treating seeing them as people, and not just objects for sex.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Literary Biography", "year": "2012", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Penguin Books Ltd", "language": "english", "pages": "240", "ISBN10": "067008414X", "file": "PDF, 2.77 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/16891426", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16891426/45d79c"},

Griffith", "Adrian A. Paradis", "Marlys Johnson"], "rating": "0", "description": "Chester Pierce was born in 1927; by 1952 he was a graduate of the  Harvard Medical School. He went on to become president of the American  Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and president of the American  Orthopsychiatric Association. He was elected to the Institute of  Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences and had an annual research  seminar named after him by the National Medical Association. Founding chair of the Black Psychiatrists of America, Pierce  has profoundly affected American psychiatry and the thinking of African  American psychiatrists during the last two decades. While recognized for  his substantive scholarship on coping with extreme environments such as  the South Pole, he is probably best known for his theories regarding  how blacks cope with racism in the United States. In Race and Excellence, Ezra Griffith, also an African  American professor of psychiatry, engages Pierce in a dialogue with the  goal of clarifying the inter-connection between the personal and the  professional in the lives of both black scholars. The text melds the  story of Pierce's life and his achievements, with particular attention  to his theories about the predictable nature of racist behavior and the  responses of oppressed groups. Having earned his doctorate a generation  after Pierce, Griffith approaches his conversation with Pierce as a  face-to-face meeting between mentor and student. Retelling Pierce's life  story ultimately becomes for Griffith an exercise in conceptualizing  his own experience. As he writes, \u201cI never just wanted to tell Chet's  story; I wanted to work his story out, to measure it, to try it on, to  figure out which parts are good for me and other blacks so earnestly  seeking heroes.\u201d", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "1998", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University Of Iowa Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0877456283", "ISBN13": "9781587290978", "file": "EPUB, 986 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1077009/95de41"},

In the biting, hilarious vein of What Doesn\u2019t Kill You Makes You Blacker and We Are Never Meeting in Real Life comes Ben Philippe\u2019s candid memoir-in-essays, chronicling a lifetime of being the Black friend (see also: foreign kid, boyfriend, coworker, student, teacher, roommate, enemy) in predominantly white spaces. In an era in which \u201cI have many black friends\u201d is often a medal of Wokeness, Ben hilariously chronicles the experience of being on the receiving end of those fist bumps. He takes us through his immigrant childhood, from wanting nothing more than friends to sit with at lunch, to his awkward teenage years, to college in the age of Obama, and adulthood in the Trump administration\u2014two sides of the same American coin. Ben takes his role as your new black friend seriously, providing original and borrowed wisdom on stereotypes, slurs, the whole \u201cswimming thing,\u201d how much Beyonc\u00e9 is too much Beyonc\u00e9, Black Girl Magic, the rise of the Karens, affirmative action, the Black Lives Matter movement, and other conversations you might want to have with your new BBFF. Oscillating between the impulse to be \"one of the good ones\" and the occasional need to excuse himself to the restrooms, stuff his mouth with toilet paper, and scream, Ben navigates his own Blackness as an \"Oreo\" with too many opinions for his father\u2019s liking, an encyclopedic knowledge of CW teen dramas, and a mouth he can't always control. From cheating his way out of swim tests to discovering stray family members in unlikely places, he finds the punchline in the serious while acknowledging the blunt truths of existing as a Black man in today\u2019s world. Extremely timely, Sure, I\u2019ll Be Your Black Friend is a conversational take on topics both light and heavy, universal and deeply personal, which reveals incisive truths about the need for connection in all of us.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "2021", "publisher": "Harper Perennial", "language": "english", "pages": "320", "ISBN13": "9780063065062", "file": "EPUB, 2.34 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16360946/3604a2"},

Wood examines the ideas that guided John Quincy Adams throughout his political career. For Wood, it is Adams' understanding of The Constitution of the United States that foregrounds a crucial link between the principles laid-forth in The Declaration of Independence and the original intent of the Framers of The Constitution. Heir to the Fathers traces this link through an examination of Adams' celebrated essay, Jubilee of the Constitution and, most significantly, through his defense of a group of Africans who mutinied aboard the slave ship Amistad. The contradictory relationship between what is stated The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution and the treatment of African slaves has been a persistent problem in any attempt to understand the legacy of freedom in the United States. Adams' argument before the Supreme Court, based on his interpretation of constitutional law, is an example of how this unique political mind comes to terms with this contradiction without abandoning the spirit of America's founding principles. Wood's discussion of Adams' political and intellectual life invites readers to reexamination the principles upon which the United States of America was founded.

But his influence extends beyond statistics, and at long last here is the first definitive biography of one of baseball\u2019s immortal figures. \u00a0Based on meticulous research and interviews with former teammates, family, two former presidents, and Aaron himself, The Last Hero chronicles Aaron\u2019s childhood in segregated Alabama, his brief stardom in the Negro Leagues, his complicated relationship with celebrity, and his historic rivalry with Willie Mays\u2014all culminating in the defining event of his life: his shattering of Babe Ruth\u2019s all-time home-run record. \u00a0Bryant also examines Aaron\u2019s more complex second act: his quest to become an important voice beyond the ball field when his playing days had ended, his rediscovery by a public disillusioned with today\u2019s tainted heroes, and his disappointment that his career home-run record was finally broken by Barry Bonds during the steroid era, baseball\u2019s greatest scandal. \u00a0Bryant reveals how Aaron navigated the upheavals of his time\u2014fighting against racism while at the same time benefiting from racial progress\u2014and how he achieved his goal of continuing Jackie Robinson\u2019s mission to obtain full equality for African-Americans, both in baseball and society, while he lived uncomfortably in the public spotlight.

Derek Jeter is their hero. He walks in the footsteps of Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, and Mantle, and someday his shadow will loom just as large. Yet he has never been the best player in baseball. In fact, he hasn\u2019t always been the best player on his team. But his intangible grace and Jordanesque ability to play big in the biggest of postseason moments make him the face of the modern Yankee dynasty, and of America\u2019s game.  In The Captain, best-selling author Ian O\u2019Connor draws on extensive reporting and unique access to Jeter that has spanned some fifteen years to\u00a0 reveal how a biracial kid from Michigan became New York\u2019s most beloved sports figure and the enduring symbol of the steroid-free athlete. O\u2019Connor takes us behind the scenes of a legendary baseball life and career, from Jeter\u2019s early struggles in the minor leagues, when homesickness and errors in the field threatened a stillborn career, to his heady days as a Yankee superstar and prince of the city who squired some of the world\u2019s most beautiful women, to his tense battles with former best friend A-Rod. We also witness Jeter struggling to come to terms with his declining skills and the declining favor of the only organization he ever wanted to play for, leading to a contentious contract negotiation with the Yankees that left people wondering if Jeter might end his career in a uniform without pinstripes.  Derek Jeter\u2019s march toward the Hall of Fame has been dignified and certain, but behind that leadership and hero\u2019s grace there are hidden struggles and complexities that have never been explored, until now. As Jeter closes in on 3,000 hits, a number no Yankee has ever touched, The Captain offers an incisive, exhilarating, and revealing new look at one of the game\u2019s greatest players in the gloaming of his career.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "language": "english", "pages": "852", "ISBN10": "0547327935", "ISBN13": "9780547327938", "file": "MOBI , 1.31 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1182728/c53501"},

When the beatings became unbearable, he took to petty stealing to make up the difference. As his thefts succeeded, Ernie's sense of necessity got tangled up with ambition and adventure. At thirteen, a joyride in a stolen car led to a sentence in California's harshest juvenile reformatory. The system's failure to show any mercy soon propelled L\u00f3pez into a cycle of crime and incarceration that resulted in his spending decades in some of America's most notorious prisons, including four and a half years on death row for a murder L\u00f3pez insists he did not commit.   To Alcatraz, Death Row, and Back is the personal life story of a man who refused to be broken by either an abusive father or an equally abusive criminal justice system. While L\u00f3pez freely admits that \"I've been no angel,\" his insider's account of daily life in Alcatraz and San Quentin graphically reveals the violence, arbitrary infliction of excessive punishment, and unending monotony that give rise to gang cultures within the prisons and practically insure that parolees will commit far worse crimes when they return to the streets. Rafael P\u00e9rez-Torres discusses how Ernie L\u00f3pez's experiences typify the harsher treatment that ethnic and minority suspects often receive in the American criminal justice system, as well as how they reveal the indomitable resilience of Chicanos/as and their culture. As P\u00e9rez-Torres concludes, \"L\u00f3pez's story presents us with the voice of one who--though subjected to a system meant to destroy his soul--not only endured but survived, and in surviving prevailed.\"", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "2005", "publisher": "University of Texas Press", "language": "english", "pages": "246 / 247", "ISBN10": "029270660X", "ISBN13": "9780292797024", "file": "PDF, 1.40 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1269101", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1269101/9a0bfb"},

A formidable barrier, the Atlantic Ocean profoundly influenced the lives it touched. For some brave or desperate souls, it offered an escape, a source of adventure or romance. For countless others, it provided a steady source of income. For those who voluntarily undertook the voyage, crossing the Atlantic meant hope for a better, happier life; for the millions of less-fortunate others who relocated because they had been enslaved, tricked, or banished, the Atlantic was a sea of sorrow and loss. Yet, whatever the reason, tremendous creativity and dynamism resulted from contact between people of different cultures, classes, races, ideas, and systems in Africa, Europe, and the Americas. At its most fundamental level, the syncretic nature of Atlantic world societies was created and re-created on a daily basis by myriad choices made by hundreds of thousands of individuals. By emphasizing movement and circulation in its choice of life stories, this readable and engaging volume presents a broad cross-section of people\u2014both famous and everyday\u2014whose lives and livelihoods took them across the Atlantic and brought disparate cultures into contact.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Rowman & Littlefield Publishers", "language": "english", "pages": "287", "ISBN10": "1442206985", "ISBN13": "9781442206984", "file": "PDF, 1.17 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1182144", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1182144/84c28f"},

Many have altered the outcomes of games, and some, swatted into the stands on dramatic last swings, have decided pennants and won reputations. But no home run has played a more significant role in influencing American society than Hank Aaron's 715th.   Aaron's historic blast -- and the yearlong quest leading up to it -- not only shook baseball but the world at large. It exposed prejudice, energized a flagging civil rights movement, inspired a generation of children, and also called forth the dark demons that haunted Aaron's every step and turned what should have been a joyous pursuit into a hellish nightmare. In Hank Aaron and the Home Run That Changed America, Tom Stanton, author of the prize-winning The Final Season, penetrates the burnished myth of Aaron's chase and uncovers the compelling story behind the most consequential athletic achievement of the past fifty years.   The tale takes place during tumultuous times, the years of 1973 and 1974, as the Watergate scandal unfolds and the Vietnam War sputters to an end. It's the era of Ali and Archie Bunker, of Wounded Knee and Patty Hearst, of Roe v. Wade and Billie Jean King versus Bobby Riggs, of oil shortages, and of a nation struggling with deep divisions. At the center of the social storm stands a private, dignified man -- Hank Aaron -- who rises to accept the mantle of his recently deceased idol, Jackie Robinson, and becomes emboldened by the purpose of his mission: to break the record of sport's greatest legend, Babe Ruth, not only for himself but for the advancement of all African Americans and for the good of his country.   Along the way, Aaron endures bigots, zealous fans, hate mail, FBI investigations, bodyguards, the ambivalence of his adopted hometown, a batting slump unlike any other, the sniping comments of Babe Ruth's widow, the slights of baseball's commissioner, a string of controversies, and constant threats to his and his children's lives. The story features a rich cast of characters: a friend and sometime rival, Willie Mays, who must come to terms with the end of his own career; Aaron's hard-as-iron protector, manager Eddie Mathews; a young, self-assured, occasionally cocky prot?g?, Dusty Baker; a future president, Jimmy Carter; a preacher of rising prominence, the Reverend Jesse Jackson; stars like Willie Stargell and Tom Seaver; and a roster of equally colorful, lesser-known peers.   But at the heart of the narrative is Hank Aaron, a class player who refused to preen at home plate or strut shamelessly around the bases even as he reached the pinnacle of the national pastime. Three decades later, Tom Stanton brings to life on these pages the elusive spirit of an American hero.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "2004", "language": "english", "pages": "256 / 291", "ISBN10": "0060722908", "ISBN13": "9780060751173", "file": "PDF, 2.53 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/846932", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/846932/14c884"},

Dinyar Patel examines the extraordinary life of this foundational figure in India\u2019s modern political history, a devastating critic of British colonialism who served in Parliament as the first-ever Indian MP, forged ties with anti-imperialists around the world, and established self-rule or swaraj as India\u2019s objective. \nNaoroji\u2019s political career evolved in three distinct phases. He began as the activist who formulated the \u201cdrain of wealth\u201d theory, which held the British Raj responsible for India\u2019s crippling poverty and devastating famines. His ideas upended conventional wisdom holding that colonialism was beneficial for Indian subjects and put a generation of imperial officials on the defensive. Next, he attempted to influence the British Parliament to institute political reforms. He immersed himself in British politics, forging links with socialists, Irish home rulers, suffragists, and critics of empire. With these allies, Naoroji clinched his landmark election to the House of Commons in 1892, an event noticed by colonial subjects around the world. Finally, in his twilight years he grew disillusioned with parliamentary politics and became more radical. He strengthened his ties with British and European socialists, reached out to American anti-imperialists and Progressives, and fully enunciated his demand for swaraj. Only self-rule, he declared, could remedy the economic ills brought about by British control in India. \nNaoroji is the first comprehensive study of the most significant Indian nationalist leader before Gandhi.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "2020", "edition": "True ePUB", "publisher": "Harvard University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "353", "ISBN10": "0674238206", "ISBN13": "9780674238206", "file": "EPUB, 14.66 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16813799/da3010"},

Die Korrelation zwischen Text, Autor und existentieller Fremdheitserfahrung steht dabei im Zentrum. Die Studie deutet jedoch Manns vierb\u00e4ndigen Josephsroman nicht, wie traditionell \u00fcblich, als monolithischen Block, sondern stellt die konzeptuelle Einheit des Romans in Frage und geht dabei \u00fcber bisher geleistete zeitgeschichtliche Kontextualisierungen in zweifacher Hinsicht hinaus: Zum einen differenziert sie die einzelnen B\u00e4nde als jeweils zentrale Kristallisationspunkte des sich wandelnden politischen Selbstverst\u00e4ndnisses Manns vor und w\u00e4hrend des Exils, zum anderen bezieht sie konsequent die Exil-Tageb\u00fccher und -Briefe Manns mit ein, die explizit als gleichwertige Medien narrativer Identit\u00e4tskonstruktion gelesen werden. Die Arbeit zeigt, wie pers\u00f6nliche Identit\u00e4t und \u00f6ffentlich-politische Rolle Thomas Manns unter den Bedingungen des Exils in drei verschiedenen Textsorten zugleich narrativ rekonstruiert, stabilisiert und neu konstituiert werden, und welch zentrale Rolle Heimat- und Fremdheitserfahrungen, Ausgrenzungs- und Integrationsmechanismen dabei spielen.

Haar werk is tegenwoordig onbetaalbaar. Ze is de legende geworden die haar tragische levensverhaal belooft: onder anderen Trotski, Weston en Rivera waren haar minnaars, ze dweepte met het marxisme, was openlijk biseksueel en haar betoverende kunst werd tegen wil en dank surrealistisch gedoopt In deze biografie wordt beschreven hoe de Mexicaanse schilderes Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) zich ontwikkelde tot een belangrijk surrealistische schilder, die pas een jaar voor haar dood erkenning begon te krijgen. Met haar man, de toen gevierde schilder en volksheld Diego Rivera, leidde ze een stormachtig leven, tot haar gezondheid haar aan bed kluisterde. De Amerikaanse kunsthistoricus Hayden Herrera heeft een boeiende en evenwichtige biografie geschreven, waarin de vele opgenomen brieven van Kahlo het geheel extra levendig maken. Ook haar werk wordt goed en duidelijk besproken. Daarmee is deze biografie beter en informatiever dan Rauda Jamis' 'Frida Kahlo, een vrouw'.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "2020", "publisher": "Atlas Contact", "language": "dutch", "ISBN13": "9789045043067", "file": "EPUB, 1.77 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16452990/4359b2"},

In 2003 kreeg de Amsterdamse verkering met een boer met koeien en ging ze met hem samenwonen op zijn boerderij in de Achterhoek. Inmiddels is ze zeventien jaar verloofd met Boer en hoewel Irene voor altijd \u2018import\u2019 zal zijn en nog wekelijks een of meerdere dagen in Amsterdam verblijft, is ze een heuse Achterhoekse geworden. In \u2018Uitgemolken\u2019 schrijft Van der Aart, net als in het eerder verschenen \u2018De Boer op\u2019, aanstekelijk en met veel vrolijkheid over de verschillen tussen het leven in de stad en dat op het platteland. Maar ze schrijft ook over de moeilijke keuzes die veel boeren momenteel moeten maken, want onlangs veranderde er iets ingrijpends: Boer deed de koeien de deur uit. De toegenomen regelgeving, \u2018planetproof\u2019 melken en de niet altijd even eerlijke kritiek op de boeren maakten het werk er al niet leuker op, maar een hardnekkig terugkerende hernia blijkt pas echt funest voor de motivatie van Boer. Invoelend en met humor laat Irene van der Aart in \u2018Uitgemolken\u2019 zien wat het betekent om te stoppen met het melkveebedrijf dat al generaties in de familie van Boer zit. Ook werpt ze een aantal belangrijke vragen op: is ons voedsel eigenlijk niet veel te goedkoop? En is de reden waarom de boeren een voor een afhaken niet dat ze eigenlijk te lang zijn uitgemolken?", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Peoples & Cultures - Biography", "year": "2020", "publisher": "Atlas Contact", "language": "dutch", "pages": "160", "ISBN13": "9789045040271", "file": "EPUB, 3.92 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16452970/863527"},

Alles is weg: haar geliefde broer Edwin is jong overleden, haar vader, de ooit zo succesvolle ondernemer A-3 Martens, is aan lager wal geraakt en als dakloze junk gestorven op Aruba. \n\r\nOp dat moment komen haar vechtersmentaliteit en levenslust dubbel en dwars naar boven. Ze schrijft haar levensverhaal van zich af en stuurt een enthousiaste brief naar het KRO-programma Memories. Met haar vriendinnen Roos en Marina wil ze terug naar Chersonissos, op Kreta. De plek waar ze elkaar dan 25 jaar geleden als hostesses bij Holland International ontmoet hebben.  \n\r\nDankzij Memories vindt Karin haar grote liefde terug, de charismatische Griek Yiannis Kakakis. Haar levenslange droom wordt eindelijk waarheid: oud worden boven op een Griekse berg.\n\r\nNever too Late vertelt het inspirerende verhaal over de Griekse jaren van Karin. Het boek biedt een bijzondere blik achter de schermen bij de veelbesproken aflevering over Karin en Yiannis van het programma Memories.  Het is een verhaal van verdriet en verlies, maar vooral van hoop, pure, onverwoestbare liefde en een nooit aflatend geloof in jezelf.  \n\r\nKarin Martens (1965) was hostess bij Holland International, ondernemer, interieurstylist en schrijfster.  Haar vele avonturen voerden haar vanuit het Brabantse Wouw via San Francisco, Kreta, Thailand, Indonesi\u00eb en Aruba uiteindelijk weer terug naar Kreta en haar grote liefde Yiannis.

The truth, as usual, is more complicated than the myth. The oldest surviving child of King Henry VIII, she grew up in an era of religious and political turmoil, both in England and abroad, and though united in its Christianity, the continent was divided in how it approached that faith. A growing wave of protest and dissent had been met with brutal suppression in the 15th century, only to emerge like a phoenix from the flames in the form of Protestantism. With religious faith and political practice deeply intertwined, countries were being torn apart in a growing conflict between Catholics and Protestants.Mary\u2019s life was shaped by her experience of this, and by the twisted family politics of her father, Henry VIII. Henry VIII\u2019s lone mail heir, his young son Edward, was a strong Protestant but a sickly teen, and as it became clear he would not survive to adulthood, Edward did not want his crown to pass to Mary, a zealous Catholic whose brutal reign would include 280 \u201cheretics\u201d being burned at the stake during the \u201cMarian Persecutions\u201d. However, Edward could see no constitutional, or indeed non-arbitrary, way to pass over Mary and instead choose the younger sister, Elizabeth. Hence, in his typical schoolboy penmanship, Edward\u2019s will attempted to override the Succession to the Crown Act 1543 (advocated by his father and passed by Parliament), bar both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declare as his heir Lady Jane Grey, who was the granddaughter of Henry VIII\u2019s sister Mary. Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by the Privy Council, possibly under duress, but her support soon waned after her own close blood relations distanced themselves from her, and she was deposed after just over a week.Given this background, it is hardly surprising then that her reign epitomized an extreme reaction against these upheavals. Mary\u2019s behavior was rightly viewed with fear and anger by many but in hindsight, it is hard not to pity the woman who took these terrible steps. Emotionally betrayed by her father, her husband and even her own body, Mary\u2019s life is one of the great tragedies of the English crown.It also hasn\u2019t helped Mary\u2019s legacy that she was succeeded by one of England\u2019s greatest monarchs, her younger sister Elizabeth. Elizabeth I was the last Tudor sovereign, and she would improve upon her predecessors\u2019 successes and mitigate their failures. In the process, she would lend her name to the Elizabethan Age and set Great Britain on its future imperial course.Bloody Mary: The Life and Legacy of England\u2019s Most Notorious Queen traces the life of Mary and the history of her short reign.

But his influence extends beyond statistics, and at long last here is the first definitive biography of one of baseball\u2019s immortal figures.       Based on meticulous research and interviews with former teammates, family, two former presidents, and Aaron himself, *The Last Hero *chronicles Aaron\u2019s childhood in segregated Alabama, his brief stardom in the Negro Leagues, his complicated relationship with celebrity, and his historic rivalry with Willie Mays\u2014all culminating in the defining event of his life: his shattering of Babe Ruth\u2019s all-time home-run record.       Bryant also examines Aaron\u2019s more complex second act: his quest to become an important voice beyond the ball field when his playing days had ended, his rediscovery by a public disillusioned with today\u2019s tainted heroes, and his disappointment that his career home-run record was finally broken by Barry Bonds during the steroid era, baseball\u2019s greatest scandal.       Bryant reveals how Aaron navigated the upheavals of his time\u2014fighting against racism while at the same time benefiting from racial progress\u2014and how he achieved his goal of continuing Jackie Robinson\u2019s mission to obtain full equality for African-Americans, both in baseball and society, while he lived uncomfortably in the public spotlight. Eloquently written, detailed and penetrating, this is a revelatory portrait of a complicated, private man who through sports became an enduring American icon.      * * *  **Questions for Howard Bryant on *The Last Hero***  **Q:** Why Henry Aaron?   **A:** After my second book, *Juicing the Game*, the natural progression for my thought process was heading toward one question: \"Who in baseball do you admire? Is there anyone this sport can be proud of?\" It wasn't simply the fatigue of writing about steroids and tainted heroes that drifted me toward Henry Aaron, but because the steroids scandal occurring during the same time as the housing-and-mortgage scandal told me something larger was taking place in this country, that the value systems we ostensibly seek--honor, integrity, accountability--were becoming almost quaint. In baseball, as the drug scandal intensified, players would tell me, \"If you ain\u2019t cheating, you ain\u2019t trying.\" It was that level of cynicism that made me consider writing about someone who certainly was not perfect but had a larger mission for himself beyond money, that here was a person for whom those values are not quaint.  **Q:** Did he cooperate?   **A:** It took roughly eighteen months for him to agree to speak with me. I first began working on this project in May 2006 and that was in the middle of when Barry Bonds was nearing Henry\u2019s record. Henry Aaron wanted nothing to do with the Bonds record chase. He didn't want to be asked questions about Bonds, did not want to be placed in the debate about anabolic steroids. He did not want to engage at all.      When Henry's attorney, Allan Tanenbaum, and I spoke for the first time, he was extremely pessimistic about the book and the public's reaction to Henry Aaron. He was convinced that the public did not care about him except in being positioned as the polar opposite of Bonds. He was certain that I was only interested in one thing: Bonds. Over many phone calls spanning several months (the key conversation taking place over Thanksgiving 2007), Allan finally accepted that my motives for writing the book had nothing to do with Bonds and everything to do with a man I considered to be an American icon.      A few months later, on January 31 (ironically on Jackie Robinson\u2019s birthday), Henry Aaron and I had our first phone call. He was extremely pleasant and engaging but echoed Allan's sentiments about his own life. \"People don\u2019t care about me,\" he told me. \"They only care about what I did as a baseball player. There\u2019s more to me than that.\" I was amazed at the considerable divide that existed between the enthusiasm I received whenever I mentioned the possibility of writing about Henry and what he considered to be the public's perception of him.  **Q:** What most surprised you during the writing/research?    **A:** There were many surprising aspects of the research, which is why I truly love to research and write books. Whatever your initial thoughts of your subject are, they will invariably be altered the deeper you learn.      I was as guilty as anyone in following the accepted Aaron myth: played in Milwaukee, was always overshadowed by players in bigger markets, snuck up on even the shrewdest evaluators of talent from the day he entered the big leagues to the day when suddenly he and not Willie Mays was in the best position to break Babe Ruth's all-time home run record.     None of this is true, and that was the most surprising thing. Henry Aaron was a phenom, a top prospect from the day he joined the Indianapolis Clowns. He was a comet tearing through each level in the minor leagues, and when he arrived for his first spring in Bradenton, Florida in 1954, all eyes were on him to be the next great player.     The myth came later. As the Milwaukee Braves fell in the standings at the beginning of the 1960s, people did begin to forget about Henry, and he quietly accumulated Hall of Fame numbers. But that was only because the public lost interest in a losing team, not because it was unaware of his enormous ability.  **Q:** What is the lasting legacy of Henry Aaron?   **A:** A famous sociologist told me during an interview that the steroid scandal has created a gap between the record holders and the standard bearers of major league baseball. Barry Bonds is a record holder. Henry Aaron is a standard bearer. The latter is far more important and valuable than the former.      And it carries weight beyond the baseball diamond, where Henry always wanted respect. He spent his life being compared on the baseball diamond to Willie Mays, but Henry Aaron wanted to follow in the legacy of Jackie Robinson, to use his platform to provide opportunities for people who did not have them. Baseball was simply a means to that end.

ESPN reporter Bryant (*Juicing the Game*) portrays Aaron's journey from Jim Crow Alabama to superstardom with the Milwaukee, then Atlanta Braves during the 1950s, '60s, and '70s as both a sports saga and a struggle against racism. (The Braves' spring training facilities stayed segregated into the 1960s, and Aaron's 1974 breaking of Babe Ruth's home run record was marred by racist death threats.) But while the author takes very seriously the sports commentator's traditional task of investing trivia with near-biblical portentousness\u2014And thus it came to pass that Henry Aaron became the first black majority owner of the first BMW franchise in the country\u2014he never quite succeeds at establishing Aaron's heroic stature. The slugger comes off as a superlatively skillful but unspectacular player whose civil rights activism is cautious and muted (though more outspoken later when he became a Braves executive). Throughout, he's a wary, reticent man given to rancor over slights, and the narrative can't help wandering toward more charismatic figures like Willie Mays and Jackie Robinson. Mightily as he swings, Bryant fails to knock Aaron's story out of the park. Photos. *(May 11)*    Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In each sketch, Brown will explore women's motivation to study the field and detail their often quite significant accomplishments.

As a leader of campaigns for Aboriginal rights and against racial discrimination, Faith Bandler emerged as an unlikely but compelling public figure - a politically effective woman in a public culture dominated by men, a politician outside parliament and a black leader in a nation dedicated for most of her life to the ideal of \"White Australia\".  The success of the 1967 referendum to afford full citizenship rights to Aboriginal Australians was a tribute to her leadership and influence - to this day, of more than 40 attempts to change the Constitution by referendum, only eight have succeeded.

And so she did. Gone were the days when only posh restaurants with European chefs were reviewed. Reichl, with a highly developed knowledge and love of Asian cuisine from her years as a West Coast food critic, began to review the small simple establishments that abound in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Many loved it, the Establishment hated it, but her influence was significant. She brought a fresh writing style to her reviews and adopted a radical way of getting them. Amassing a wardrobe of wigs and costumes, she deliberately disguised herself so that she would not receive special treatment. As a result, she had a totally different dining experience as say, Miriam the Jewish mother than she did as Ruth Reichl the reviewer, and she wasn't afraid to write about it. The resulting reviews were hilarious and sobering, full of fascinating insights and delicious gossip.

Her short life had hardly been a happy  one. By nature impulsive, capricious, and vehement, she had always longed for  liberty; and she had never possessed it. She had been brought up among violent  family quarrels, had been early separated from her disreputable and eccentric  mother, and handed over to the care of her disreputable and selfish father. When  she was seventeen, he decided to marry her off to the Prince of Orange; she, at  first, acquiesced; but, suddenly falling in love with Prince Augustus of  Prussia, she determined to break off the engagement. This was not her first love  affair, for she had previously carried on a clandestine correspondence with a  Captain Hess. Prince Augustus was already married, morganatically, but she did  not know it, and he did not tell her. While she was spinning out the  negotiations with the Prince of Orange, the allied sovereign--it was June,  1814--arrived in London to celebrate their victory. Among them, in the suite of  the Emperor of Russia, was the young and handsome Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.  He made several attempts to attract the notice of the Princess, but she, with  her heart elsewhere, paid very little attention. Next month the Prince Regent,  discovering that his daughter was having secret meetings with Prince Augustus,  suddenly appeared upon the scene and, after dismissing her household, sentenced  her to a strict seclusion in Windsor Park. \"God Almighty grant me patience!\" she  exclaimed, falling on her knees in an agony of agitation: then she jumped up,  ran down the backstairs and out into the street, hailed a passing cab, and drove  to her mother's house in Bayswater. She was discovered, pursued, and at length,  yielding to the persuasions of her uncles, the Dukes of York and Sussex, of  Brougham, and of the Bishop of Salisbury, she returned to Carlton House at two  o'clock in the morning. She was immured at Windsor, but no more was heard of the  Prince of Orange. Prince Augustus, too, disappeared. The way was at last open to  Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. This Prince was clever enough to get round the Regent, to impress the  Ministers, and to make friends with another of the Princess's uncles, the Duke  of Kent. Through the Duke he was able to communicate privately with the  Princess, who now declared that he was necessary to her happiness. When, after  Waterloo, he was in Paris, the Duke's aide-de-camp carried letters backwards and  forwards across the Channel. In January 1816 he was invited to England, and in  May the marriage took place. \"", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2002", "publisher": "IndyPublish", "language": "english", "pages": "317", "ISBN10": "1404326820", "ISBN13": "9781404326828", "file": "PDF, 17.32 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1165089", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1165089/612eff"},

Raymer were hurriedly flown to Oahu from the mainland. The divers have been given a Herculean task; to rescue the sailors and Marines trapped below, and resurrect the pride of the Pacific fleet. Now for the first time, the chief diver of the Pearl Harbor salvage operations, Cmdr. Edward C. Raymer, USN (Ret.), tells the whole story, in the only book available that describes the raising and salvage operations of sunken battleships following the December 7th attack.  Once Raymer and his crew of divers entered the interiors of the sunken shipwrecks, attempting untested and potentially deadly diving techniques, they experienced a world of total blackness, unable to see even the faceplates of their helmets. By memorising the ships' blueprints and using their sense of touch, the divers groped their way hundreds of feet inside the sunken vessels to make repairs and salvage vital war material. The divers learned how to cope with such unseen dangers as falling objects, sharks, the eerie presence of floating human bodies, and the constant threat of Japanese attacks from above.  Though many of these divers were killed or seriously injured during the wartime salvage operations, on the whole they had great success performing what seemed to be impossible jobs.

President Reagan endeared himself even to his political opponents with his self-effacing wit and irrepressible optimism. Inspiring, thoughtful, and at times downright funny, he had an amazing gift for stirring emotion, sparking debate, and calling a nation to action.

Gen. Hal Moore and Joe Galloway return to Vietnam and reflect on how the war changed them, their men, their enemies, and both countries\u2014often with surprising results.   More than fifteen years since its original publication, the number one New York Times bestseller We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young is still required reading in all branches of the military. Now Moore and Galloway revisit their relationships with ten American veterans of the battle\u2014men such as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley and helicopter pilot Bruce \"Old Snake\" Crandall\u2014as well as Lt. Gen. Nguyen Hu An, who commanded the North Vietnamese Army troops on the other side, and two of his old company commanders. These men and their countries have all changed dramatically since the first head-on collision between the two great armies back in November 1965.   Traveling back to the red-dirt battlefields, commanders and veterans from both sides make the long and difficult journey from old enemies to new friends. After a trip in a Russian-made helicopter to the Ia Drang Valley in the Central Highlands, with the Vietnamese pilots using Moore's vintage U.S. Army maps and Galloway's Boy Scout compass to guide them, they reach the hallowed ground where so many died. All the men are astonished at how nature has reclaimed the land once scarred by bullets, napalm, and blood. As darkness falls, the unthinkable happens\u2014the authors and many of their old comrades are stranded overnight, alone, left to confront the ghosts of the departed among the termite hills and creek bed.   Moore and Galloway combine gritty and vivid detail with reverence and respect for their comrades. Their ability to capture man's sense of heroism and brotherhood, their love for their men and their former enemies, and their fascination with the history of this enigmatic country make for riveting reading. With sixteen pages of photos, tributes to departed friends and loved ones, and General Moore's reflections on lessons learned throughout his military career, We Are Soldiers Still puts a human face on warfare in a way that will not soon be forgotten.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2008", "edition": "1", "language": "english", "pages": "272 / 284", "ISBN10": "0061147761", "ISBN13": "9780061699788", "file": "PDF, 6.62 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/965213", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/965213/f02975"},

Why was there a mad rush by CIA counterintelligence chief James Angleton to locate and confiscate her diary? What in that diary was so explosive? Had Mary Meyer finally put together the intricate pieces of a plan to assassinate her lover, President Kennedy, with the trail ultimately leading to the CIA? And was it mere coincidence that Mary was killed less than three weeks after the release of the Warren Commission report?  These are the questions that author Peter Janney finally answers in a way that no one else ever has. In doing so, he may well have solved Washington\u2019s most famous unsolved murder.

In this vivid account of the U.S. Army's legendary 10th Mountain Division's heroic stand in the mountains of Afghanistan, Captain Sean Parnell shares an action-packed and highly emotional true story of triumph, tragedy, and the extraordinary bonds forged in battle.   At twenty-four years of age, U.S. Army Ranger Sean Parnell was named commander of a forty-man elite infantry platoon\u2014a unit that came to be known as the Outlaws\u2014and was tasked with rooting out Pakistan-based insurgents from a mountain valley along Afghanistan's eastern frontier. Parnell and his men assumed they would be facing a ragtag bunch of civilians, but in May 2006 what started out as a routine patrol through the lower mountains of the Hindu Kush became a brutal ambush. Barely surviving the attack, Parnell's men now realized that they faced the most professional and seasoned force of light infantry the U.S. Army had encountered since the end of World War II.   What followed was sixteen months of close combat, over the course of which the platoon became Parnell's family: from Staff Sergeant Greg Greeson, the wise, chain-smoking veteran who never lost his cool; to Specialist Robert Pinholt, a buttoned-down conservative with the heart of a warrior and the mind of an economist; to Staff Sergeant Phil Baldwin, the platoon's voice of calm and reason, a man who sacrificed everything following the events of 9/11\u2014career, home, financial stability\u2014to serve his country. But the cost of battle was high for these men: Over 80 percent were wounded in action, putting their casualty rate among the highest since Gettysburg, and not all of them made it home.   A searing and unforgettable story of friendship in battle, Outlaw Platoon brings to life the intensity and raw emotion of those sixteen months, showing how the fight reshaped the lives of Parnell and his men and how the love and faith they found in one another ultimately kept them alive.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2012", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "William Morrow", "language": "english", "pages": "384", "ISBN10": "0062066390", "ISBN13": "9780062066398", "file": "EPUB, 2.56 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1304632/cb38f9"},

Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader known to be ensconced in a Taliban stronghold surrounded by a small but heavily armed force. Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive.      This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history. But it is also, more than anything, the story of his teammates, who fought ferociously beside him until he was the last one left-blasted unconscious by a rocket grenade, blown over a cliff, but still armed and still breathing. Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers. A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow-by-blow, through the brutal training of America's warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks. In this rich , moving chronicle of courage, honor, and patriotism, Marcus Luttrell delivers one of the most powerful narratives ever written about modern warfare-and a tribute to his teammates, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Little, Brown and Company", "language": "english", "pages": "390", "ISBN10": "0316067598", "ISBN13": "9780316067591", "file": "EPUB, 4.03 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2216303/36548c"},

Indians armed with poison-tipped arrows haunt its shadows; piranhas glide through its waters; boulder-strewn rapids turn the river into a roiling cauldron.After his humiliating election defeat in 1912, Roosevelt set his sights on the most punishing physical challenge he could find, the first descent of an unmapped, rapids-choked tributary of the Amazon. Together with his son Kermit and Brazil\u2019s most famous explorer, C?ndido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Roosevelt accomplished a feat so great that many at the time refused to believe it.

Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power gives us Jefferson the politician and president, a great and complex human being forever engaged in the wars of his era. Philosophers think; politicians maneuver. Jefferson\u2019s genius was that he was both and could do both, often simultaneously. Such is the art of power. \u00a0 Thomas Jefferson hated confrontation, and yet his understanding of power and of human nature enabled him to move men and to marshal ideas, to learn from his mistakes, and to prevail. Passionate about many things\u2014women, his family, books, science, architecture, gardens, friends, Monticello, and Paris\u2014Jefferson loved America most, and he strove over and over again, despite fierce opposition, to realize his vision: the creation, survival, and success of popular government in America. Jon Meacham lets us see Jefferson\u2019s world as Jefferson himself saw it, and to appreciate how Jefferson found the means to endure and win in the face of rife partisan division, economic uncertainty, and external threat. Drawing on archives in the United States, England, and France, as well as unpublished Jefferson presidential papers, Meacham presents Jefferson as the most successful political leader of the early republic, and perhaps in all of American history. \u00a0 The father of the ideal of individual liberty, of the Louisiana Purchase, of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and of the settling of the West, Jefferson recognized that the genius of humanity\u2014and the genius of the new nation\u2014lay in the possibility of progress, of discovering the undiscovered and seeking the unknown. From the writing of the Declaration of Independence to elegant dinners in Paris and in the President\u2019s House; from political maneuverings in the boardinghouses and legislative halls of Philadelphia and New York to the infant capital on the Potomac; from his complicated life at Monticello, his breathtaking house and plantation in Virginia, to the creation of the University of Virginia, Jefferson was central to the age. Here too is the personal Jefferson, a man of appetite, sensuality, and passion. \u00a0 The Jefferson story resonates today not least because he led his nation through ferocious partisanship and cultural warfare amid economic change and external threats, and also because he embodies an eternal drama, the struggle of the leadership of a nation to achieve greatness in a difficult and confounding world.Advance praise for Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power \u00a0 \u201cJon Meacham resolves the bundle of contradictions that was Thomas Jefferson by probing his love of progress and thirst for power. This is a thrilling and affecting portrait of our first philosopher-politician.\u201d\u2014Stacy Schiff \u00a0 \u201cThis terrific book allows us to see the political genius of Thomas Jefferson better than we have ever seen it before.

N. Simmons", "Tiffany Aaron"], "rating": "0", "description": "In this triumphant new work already hailed as a powerful American epic, Laurence Leamer chronicles the Kennedy men and their struggle to create the most powerful family in the United States. The Kennedy Men is the first volume in a multi-generational history that will forever change the way America views its most famous family. Beginning in 1901 with twelve-year-old Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. delivering hats to Boston's social elite and ending in 1963 with the assassination of his son, President John F. Kennedy, Leamer seamlessly unites the complex strands of their economic, political, and social rise.This magnificent new volume is based on four years of interviews with Kennedy insiders and experts, as well as in-depth research including unprecedented new sources and materials: the private archives of JFK's longtime secretary Evelyn Lincoln, secret tapes JFK recorded in the Oval Office, revealing letters from the president's doctors, Rose Kennedy's never-before-heard interview tapes, and interviews with CIA operatives and Kennedy family members.Throughout, The Kennedy Men brings to life five bold, ambitious men. The Kennedy patriarch, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., was one of the richest, strongest men in America's history. His firstborn son, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., was the heir apparent, a handsome, gregarious youth who died a hero's death. John F. Kennedy picked up his brother's fallen mantle and carried it all the way to the White House. Leamer details the heartbreaking story of President Kennedy's health and how it affected not only him, but also America and the world. Robert F. Kennedy, his brother's liege, was an attorney general of unprecedented power, fighting both organized crime and a secret war against Castro. Edward M. Kennedy, the youngest of that generation of Kennedy men, was a fun-loving athlete who reluctantly headed up the hard road to power.Combining powerful dramatic narrative with impeccably researched detail, Leamer illuminates the Kennedys' aspirations and love of family, their accomplishments and failures, their heroism and frailty, their loves and passions, and their patriotism and selfishness. Filled with startling revelations from headline-making stories of great events within the Oval Office such as the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis to the secret untold tales of their wives and lovers-the story of the Kennedy men is here in all its triumph and tragedy. It is a spellbinding personal history of individuals and a journey of character through time told by a brilliant, masterful writer.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2010", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "HarperCollins Publishers", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0688163157", "ISBN13": "9780062039880", "file": "EPUB, 2.66 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1043564/d8482d"},

Persico", "Ernesto A. Longa", "Rick Reichart", "Sasha Reichart"], "rating": "0", "description": "All American presidents are commanders in chief by law. Few perform as such in practice. In Roosevelt\u2019s Centurions, distinguished historian Joseph E. Persico reveals how, during World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt seized the levers of wartime power like no president since Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Declaring himself \u201cDr. Win-the-War,\u201d FDR assumed the role of strategist in chief, and, though surrounded by star-studded generals and admirals, he made clear who was running the war. FDR was a hands-on war leader, involving himself in everything from choosing bomber targets to planning naval convoys to the design of landing craft. Persico explores whether his strategic decisions, including his insistence on the Axis powers\u2019 unconditional surrender, helped end or may have prolonged the war. \u00a0 Taking us inside the Allied war councils, the author reveals how the president brokered strategy with contentious allies, particularly the iron-willed Winston Churchill; rallied morale on the home front; and handpicked a team of proud, sometimes prickly warriors who, he believed, could fight a global war. Persico\u2019s history offers indelible portraits of the outsize figures who roused the \u201csleeping giant\u201d that defeated the Axis war machine: the dutiful yet independent-minded George C. Marshall, charged with rebuilding an army whose troops trained with broomsticks for rifles, eggs for hand grenades; Dwight Eisenhower, an unassuming Kansan elevated from obscurity to command of the greatest fighting force ever assembled; the vainglorious Douglas MacArthur; and the bizarre battlefield genius George S. Patton. Here too are less widely celebrated military leaders whose contributions were just as critical: the irascible, dictatorial navy chief, Ernest King; the acerbic army advisor in China, \u201cVinegar\u201d Joe Stilwell; and Henry H. \u201cHap\u201d Arnold, who zealously preached the gospel of modern air power. The Roosevelt who emerges from these pages is a wartime chess master guiding America\u2019s armed forces to a victory that was anything but foreordained. \u00a0 What are the qualities we look for in a commander in chief? In an era of renewed conflict, when Americans are again confronting the questions that FDR faced\u2014about the nature and exercise of global power\u2014Roosevelt\u2019s Centurions is a timely and revealing examination of what it takes to be a wartime leader in a freewheeling, complicated, and tumultuous democracy.Praise for Roosevelt\u2019s Centurions  \u00a0\u201cFDR\u2019s centurions were my heroes and guides.

Now, in his first book written for a wide audience, he offers a marvelous biography of the Prophet Muhammad, one that highlights the spiritual and ethical teachings of one of the most influential figures in human history.        Here is a fresh and perceptive look at Muhammad, capturing a life that was often eventful, gripping, and highly charged. Ramadan provides both an intimate portrait of a man who was shy, kind, but determined, as well as a dramatic chronicle of a leader who launched a great religion and inspired a vast empire. More important, Ramadan presents the main events of the Prophet's life in a way that highlights his spiritual and ethical teachings. The book underscores the significance of the Prophet's example for some of today's most controversial issues, such as the treatment of the poor, the role of women, Islamic criminal punishments, war, racism, and relations with other religions. Selecting those facts and stories from which we can draw a profound and vivid spiritual picture, the author asks how can the Prophet's life remain--or become again--an example, a model, and an inspiration? And how can Muslims move from formalism--a fixation on ritual--toward a committed spiritual and social presence?      In this thoughtful and engaging biography, Ramadan offers Muslims a new understanding of Muhammad's life and he introduces non-Muslims not just to the story of the Prophet, but to the spiritual and ethical riches of Islam.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2007", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "256", "ISBN10": "0195308808", "ISBN13": "9780199705467", "file": "PDF, 36.98 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/824746", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/824746/088609"},

On April 10, when the German troops marched into Zagreb, the Croatian capital, they were greeted as liberators by the Croats.

Ferrell", "K.A. Matis", "Richard Koch"], "rating": "0", "description": "Few US presidents have captured the imagination of the American people as has Harry S. Truman, \"the man from Missouri\". In this biography, Ferrell challenges the popular characterisation of Truman as a modest man who rarely sought the offices he received, revealing instead a quick-witted politician whose skill and honest commitment to service paved the road to the nation's highest office. Truman was ambitious in the best sense of the word. His powerful commitment to service was accompanied by a remarkable shrewdness and an exceptional ability to judge people. He regarded himself as a consummate politician, a designation of which he was proud. While in Washington, he never succumbed to the \"Potomac fever\" that swelled the heads of so many in that city. A generally honest man, Truman exhibited only one lapse when, at the beginning of 1941, he padded his Senate payroll by adding his wife and later his sister. From his early years on the family farm through his pivotal decision to use the atomic bomb in World War II, Truman's life was filled with fascinating episodes.  Ferrell's research offers new perspectives on many key eposides in Truman's career, including his first Senate term and the circumstances surrounding the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. In addition, Ferrell taps many little-known sources to relate the story of the machinations by which Truman gained the vice presidential nomination in 1944, a position which put him a heartbeat away from the presidency.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "1994", "publisher": "Univ of Missouri Pr", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "082620953X", "ISBN13": "9780826260451", "file": "EPUB, 1.09 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1065427/040f6e"},

E. B. Du Bois declared, \u201cbig enough to be inconsistent.\u201d Big enough, indeed, for every generation to have its own Lincoln\u2014unifier or emancipator, egalitarian or racist. In an effort to reconcile these views, and to offer a more complex and nuanced account of a figure so central to American history, this book focuses on the most controversial aspect of Lincoln\u2019s thought and politics\u2014his attitudes and actions regarding slavery and race. Drawing attention to the limitations of Lincoln\u2019s judgment and policies without denying his magnitude, the book provides the most comprehensive and even-handed account available of Lincoln\u2019s contradictory treatment of black Americans in matters of slavery in the South and basic civil rights in the North.    George Fredrickson shows how Lincoln\u2019s antislavery convictions, however genuine and strong, were held in check by an equally strong commitment to the rights of the states and the limitations of federal power. He explores how Lincoln\u2019s beliefs about racial equality in civil rights, stirred and strengthened by the African American contribution to the northern war effort, were countered by his conservative constitutional philosophy, which left this matter to the states. The Lincoln who emerges from these pages is far more comprehensible and credible in his inconsistencies, and in the abiding beliefs and evolving principles from which they arose. Deeply principled but nonetheless flawed, all-too-human yet undeniably heroic, he is a Lincoln for all generations.

But how true is this claim?\n In this compact book, David L. Holmes offers a clear, concise and \r\nilluminating look at the spiritual beliefs of our founding fathers. He \r\nbegins with an informative account of the religious culture of the late \r\ncolonial era, surveying the religious groups in each colony. In \r\nparticular, he sheds light on the various forms of Deism that flourished\r\n in America, highlighting the profound influence this intellectual \r\nmovement had on the founding generation. Holmes then examines the \r\nindividual beliefs of a variety of men and women who loom large in our \r\nnational history. He finds that some, like Martha Washington, Samuel \r\nAdams, John Jay, Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson's daughters, held \r\northodox Christian views. But many of the most influential figures, \r\nincluding Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, John and Abigail Adams, \r\nJefferson, James and Dolley Madison, and James Monroe, were believers of\r\n a different stripe. Respectful of Christianity, they admired the ethics\r\n of Jesus, and believed that religion could play a beneficial role in \r\nsociety. But they tended to deny the divinity of Christ, and a few seem \r\nto have been agnostic about the very existence of God. Although the \r\nfounding fathers were religious men, Holmes shows that it was a faith \r\nquite unlike the Christianity of today's evangelicals. Holmes concludes \r\nby examining the role of religion in the lives of the presidents since \r\nWorld War II and by reflecting on the evangelical resurgence that helped\r\n fuel the reelection of George W. Bush.\n An intriguing look at a neglected aspect of our history, the book \r\nwill appeal to American history buffs as well as to anyone concerned \r\nabout the role of religion in American culture.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2006", "edition": "First Edition ~1st Printing", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "240", "ISBN10": "0195300920", "ISBN13": "9780195300925", "file": "PDF, 11.46 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/979926", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/979926/007b82"},

Jad Adams offers a concise and elegant account of Gandhi's life: from his birth and upbringing in a small princely state in Gujarat during the high noon of the British Raj, to his assassination at the hands of a Hindu extremist in 1948 only months after the birth of the independent India which he himself he had done so much to bring about.  He delineates the principal events of a career that may truly be said to have changed the world: his training as a barrister in late Victorian London; his civil rights work in Boer War-era South Africa; his leadership of the Indian National Congress; his focus on obtaining self-government and control of all Indian government institutions, and the campaigns of non-cooperation and non-violence against British rule in India whereby he sought to achieve that aim (including the famous 'Salt March' of March/April 1930); his passionate opposition to partition in 1947 and his fasts-unto-death in a bid to end the bitter and bloody sectarian violence that attended it.

Two years later she was killed by American forces not far from where she worked. Written between 1968 and 1970, her diary speaks poignantly of her devotion to family and friends, the horrors of war, her yearning for her high school sweetheart, and her struggle to prove her loyalty to her country. At times raw, at times lyrical and youthfully sentimental, her voice transcends cultures to speak of her dignity and compassion and of her challenges in the face of the war\u2019s ceaseless fury.The American officer who discovered the diary soon after Dr. Tram\u2019s death was under standing orders to destroy all documents without military value. As he was about to toss it into the flames, his Vietnamese translator said to him, \u201cDon\u2019t burn this one. . . . It has fire in it already.\u201d Against regulations, the officer preserved the diary and kept it for thirty-five years. In the spring of 2005, a copy made its way to Dr. Tram\u2019s elderly mother in Hanoi. The diary was soon published in Vietnam, causing a national sensation. Never before had there been such a vivid and personal account of the long ordeal that had consumed the nation\u2019s previous generations.Translated by Andrew X. Pham and with an introduction by Pulitzer Prize winner Frances FitzGerald, Last Night I Dreamed of Peace is an extraordinary document that narrates one woman\u2019s personal and political struggles. Above all, it is a story of hope in the most dire of circumstances\u2014told from the perspective of our historic enemy but universal in its power to celebrate and mourn the fragility of human life.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2007", "edition": "1ST", "publisher": "Crown", "language": "english", "pages": "102", "ISBN10": "0307347370", "ISBN13": "9780307347374", "file": "PDF, 461 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1185290", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1185290/e81e3c"},

Debs ran for president while serving a ten-year jail term for speaking against America\u2019s role in World War I. Though many called Debs a traitor, others praised him as a prisoner of conscience, a martyr to the cause of free speech. Nearly a million Americans agreed, voting for a man whom the government had branded an enemy to his country.    In a beautifully crafted narrative, Ernest Freeberg shows that the campaign to send Debs from an Atlanta jailhouse to the White House was part of a wider national debate over the right to free speech in wartime. Debs was one of thousands of Americans arrested for speaking his mind during the war, while government censors were silencing dozens of newspapers and magazines. When peace was restored, however, a nationwide protest was unleashed against the government\u2019s repression, demanding amnesty for Debs and his fellow political prisoners. Led by a coalition of the country\u2019s most important intellectuals, writers, and labor leaders, this protest not only liberated Debs, but also launched the American Civil Liberties Union and changed the course of free speech in wartime.     The Debs case illuminates our own struggle to define the boundaries of permissible dissent as we continue to balance the right of free speech with the demands of national security. In this memorable story of democracy on trial, Freeberg excavates an extraordinary episode in the history of one of America\u2019s most prized ideals.

Jackson was one of the giants of the Roosevelt era: an Attorney General, a still revered Supreme Court Justice and, not least important, one of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's close friends and advisers.  His intimate memoir of FDR, written in the early 1950s before Jackson's untimely death, has remained unpublished for fifty years. Here is that newly discovered memoir.      Written with skill and grace, this is truly a unique account of the personality, conduct, greatness of character, and common humanity of \"that man in the White House,\" as outraged conservatives called FDR. Jackson simply but eloquently provides an insider's view of Roosevelt's presidency, including such crucial events as FDR's Court-packing plan, his battles with corporate America, his decision to seek a third term, and his bold move to aid Britain in 1940 with American destroyers. He also offers an intimate personal portrait of Roosevelt--on fishing trips, in late-night poker games, or approving legislation while eating breakfast in bed, where he routinely began his workday. We meet a president who is far-sighted but nimble in attacking the problems at hand; principled but flexible; charismatic and popular but unafraid to pick fights, take stands, and when necessary, make enemies.       That Man is not simply a valuable historical document, but an engaging and insightful look at one of the most remarkable men in American history. In reading this memoir, we gain not only a new appreciation for Roosevelt, but also admiration for Jackson, who emerges as both a public servant of great integrity and skill and a wry, shrewd, and fair-minded observer of politics at the highest level.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2003", "edition": "First", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "337", "ISBN10": "0195168267", "ISBN13": "9780195168266", "file": "PDF, 18.77 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1054041", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1054041/8d7579"},

Mushawar (Eds.)"], "rating": "0", "description": "On March 17, 2009, Laura Ling and her colleague Euna Lee were working on a documentary about North Korean defectors who were fleeing the desperate conditions in their homeland. While filming on the Chinese\u2013North Korean border, they were chased down by North Korean soldiers who violently apprehended them. Laura and Euna were charged with trespassing and \"hostile acts,\" and imprisoned by Kim Jong Il's notoriously secretive Communist state. Kept totally apart, they endured months of interrogations and eventually a trial before North Korea's highest court. They were the first Americans ever to be sentenced to twelve years of hard labor in a prison camp in North Korea.   When news of the arrest reached Laura's sister, journalist Lisa Ling, she immediately began a campaign to get her sister released, one that led her from the State Department to the higher echelons of the media world and eventually to the White House.   Somewhere Inside reveals for the first time Laura's gripping account of what really happened on the river, her treatment at the hands of North Korean guards, and the deprivations and rounds of harrowing interrogations she endured. She speaks movingly about the emotional toll inflicted on her by her incarceration, including the measures she took to protect her sources and her fears that she might never see her family again.   Lisa writes about her unrelenting efforts to secure Laura and Euna's release. Offering insights into the vast media campaign spearheaded on the women's behalf, Lisa also takes us deep into the drama involving people at the highest levels of government, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, Senator John Kerry, and Governor Bill Richardson\u2014intense discussions that entailed strategically balancing the agendas and good intentions of the various players. She also describes her role in the back-and-forth between North Korea's demands and the dramatic rescue by former President Bill Clinton.   Though they were thousands of miles apart while Laura was in captivity, the Ling sisters' relationship became a way for the reclusive North Korean government to send messages to the United States government, which helped lead to Laura and Euna's eventual release.   Told in the sisters' alternating voices, Somewhere Inside is a timely, inspiring, and page-turning tale of survival set against the canvas of international politics that goes beyond the headlines to reveal the impact on lives engulfed by forces beyond their control. But it is also a window into the unique bond these two sisters have always shared, a bond that sustained them throughout the most horrifying ordeal of their lives.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2010", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "HarperCollins e-books", "language": "english", "pages": "322", "ISBN10": "0062000675", "ISBN13": "9780062010711", "file": "EPUB, 4.98 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1003767/b85f86"},

This book provides the first in-depth look at the intellectual life of the Turkish Republic's founder. In doing so, it frames him within the historical context of the turbulent age in which he lived, and explores the uneasy transition from the late Ottoman imperial order to the modern Turkish state through his life and ideas. Shedding light on one of the most complex and enigmatic statesmen of the modern era, M. Skr Hanioglu takes readers from Atatrk's youth as a Muslim boy in the volatile ethnic cauldron of Macedonia, to his education in nonreligious and military schools, to his embrace of Turkish nationalism and the modernizing Young Turks movement. Who was this figure who sought glory as an ambitious young officer in World War I, defied the victorious Allies intent on partitioning the Turkish heartland, and defeated the last sultan? Hanioglu charts Atatrk's intellectual and ideological development at every stage of his life, demonstrating how he was profoundly influenced by the new ideas that were circulating in the sprawling Ottoman realm. He shows how Atatrk drew on a unique mix of scientism, materialism, social Darwinism, positivism, and other theories to fashion a grand utopian framework on which to build his new nation.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0691151091", "ISBN13": "9780691151090", "file": "EPUB, 981 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1194595/c6a3d4"},

Based on research but made practical for today\u2019s leader, The Trust Edge shows that trust is quantifiable and brings dramatic results to businesses and leaders. In this book, Horsager teaches readers how to build the 8 Pillars of Trust: 1. Clarity: People trust the clear and mistrust the ambiguous. 2. Compassion: People put faith in those who care beyond themselves. 3. Character: People notice those who do what is right over what is easy. 4. Competency: People have confidence in those who stay fresh, relevant, and capable. 5. Commitment: People believe in those who stand through adversity. 6. Connection: People want to follow, buy from, and be around friends. 7. Contribution: People immediately respond to results. 8. Consistency: People love to see the little things done consistently. When leaders learn how to implement these pillars, they enjoy better relationships, reputations, retention, revenue, and results. Fascinating and timely, The Trust Edge unveils how trust has the ability to accelerate or destroy any business, organization, or relationship. The lower the trust, the more time everything takes, the more everything costs, and the lower the loyalty of everyone involved. Conversely, an environment of trust leads to greater innovation, morale, and productivity. The trusted leader is followed. From the trusted salesperson, people will buy. For the trusted brand, people will pay more, come back, and tell others. Trust, not money, is the currency of business and life!", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Free Press", "language": "english", "pages": "368 / 375", "ISBN10": "1476711372", "ISBN13": "9781476711379", "file": "PDF, 4.69 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2072723", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2072723/1c41b6"},

As seen through the eyes of his father, Joe Sacco -- a farm boy from Alabama who was flung into the chaos of Normandy and survived the terrors of the Bulge -- this is the heroic story of the young men who changed the course of history. As part of the 92nd Signal Battalion and Patton's famed Third Army, Joe and his buddies found themselves at the forefront of the Allied push through France and Germany. After more than a year of fighting, but still only twenty years old, Joe was a hardened veteran. However, nothing could have prepared him and his unit for the horrors behind the walls of Germany's infamous Dachau concentration camp. They were among the first 250 American troops into the camp, and it was there that they finally grasped the significance of the Allied mission. Surrounded by death and destruction, they not only found the courage and the will to fight, they discovered the meaning of friendship and came to understand the value and fragility of life.

Tammeus and Cukierkorn unfold many stories that have never before been made public: gripping narratives of Jews who survived against all odds and courageous non-Jews who risked their own lives to provide shelter. These are harrowing accounts of survival and bravery. Maria Devinki lived for more than two years under the floors of barns. Felix Zandman sought refuge from Anna Puchalska for a night, but she pledged to hide him for the whole war if necessary - and eventually hid several Jews for seventeen months in a pit dug beneath her house. Through some twenty stories like these, Tammeus and Cukierkorn show that even in an atmosphere of unimaginable malevolence, individuals can decide to act in civilized ways. Some rescuers had antisemitic feelings but acted because they knew and liked individual Jews. In many cases, the rescuers were simply helping friends or business associates. The accounts include the perspectives of men and women, city and rural residents, clergy and laypersons - even children who witnessed their parents' efforts. These stories show that assistance from non-Jews was crucial, but also that Jews needed ingenuity, sometimes money, and most often what some survivors called simple good luck. Sixty years later, they invite each of us to ask what we might do today if we were at risk - or were asked to risk our lives to save others.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2009", "edition": "1", "language": "english", "pages": "264 / 257", "ISBN10": "0826218768", "ISBN13": "9780826218766", "file": "PDF, 2.05 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/834969", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/834969/ed3d64"},

Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, and his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.  Here also is the Revolution as experienced by American Loyalists, Hessian mercenaries, politicians, preachers, traitors, spies, men and women of all kinds caught in the paths of war.  At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books -- Nathanael Greene, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of winter.  But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost -- Washington, who had never before led an army in battle.  The book begins in London on October 26, 1775, when His Majesty King George III went before Parliament to declare America in rebellion and to affirm his resolve to crush it. From there the story moves to the Siege of Boston and its astonishing outcome, then to New York, where British ships and British troops appear in numbers never imagined and the newly proclaimed Continental Army confronts the enemy for the first time. David McCullough's vivid rendering of the Battle of Brooklyn and the daring American escape that followed is a part of the book few readers will ever forget.  As the crucial weeks pass, defeat follows defeat, and in the long retreat across New Jersey, all hope seems gone, until Washington launches the \"brilliant stroke\" that will change history.  The darkest hours of that tumultuous year were as dark as any Americans have known. Especially in our own tumultuous time, 1776 is powerful testimony to how much is owed to a rare few in that brave founding epoch, and what a miracle it was that things turned out as they did.  Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2005", "edition": "First Edition", "language": "english", "pages": "400 / 428", "ISBN10": "0743226720", "ISBN13": "9780743226721", "file": "PDF, 2.42 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/942347", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/942347/7d0d57"},

McFeely (foreword)", "Janice H. Humphrey", "Bob J. Alcorn", "Andrew G. Bostom (Editor)"], "rating": "0", "description": "On the Boston Common stands one of the great Civil War memorials, a magnificent bronze sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. It depicts the black soldiers of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Infantry marching alongside their young white commander, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. When the philosopher William James dedicated the memorial in May 1897, he stirred the assembled crowd with these words: \"There they march, warm-blooded champions of a better day for man. There on horseback among them, in the very habit as he lived, sits the blue-eyed child of fortune.\"In this book Shaw speaks for himself with equal eloquence through nearly two hundred letters he wrote to his family and friends during the Civil War. The portrait that emerges is of a man more divided and complex--though no less heroic--than the Shaw depicted in the celebrated film Glory. The pampered son of wealthy Boston abolitionists, Shaw was no abolitionist himself, but he was among the first patriots to respond to Lincoln's call for troops after the attack on Fort Sumter. After Cedar Mountain and Antietam, Shaw knew the carnage of war firsthand. Describing nightfall on the Antietam battlefield, he wrote, \"the crickets chirped, and the frogs croaked, just as if nothing unusual had happened all day long, and presently the stars came out bright, and we lay down among the dead, and slept soundly until daylight. There were twenty dead bodies within a rod of me.\"When Federal war aims shifted from an emphasis on restoring the Union to the higher goal of emancipation for four million slaves, Shaw's mother pressured her son into accepting the command of the North's vanguard black regiment, the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts. A paternalist who never fully reconciled his own prejudices about black inferiority, Shaw assumed the command with great reluctance. Yet, as he trained his recruits in Readville, Massachusetts, during the early months of 1963, he came to respect their pluck and dedication. \"There is not the least doubt,\" he wrote his mother, \"that we shall leave the state, with as good a regiment, as any that has marched.\"Despite such expressions of confidence, Shaw in fact continued to worry about how well his troops would perform under fire. The ultimate test came in South Carolina in July 1863, when the Fifty-fourth led a brave but ill-fated charge on Fort Wagner, at the approach to Charleston Harbor. As Shaw waved his sword and urged his men forward, an enemy bullet felled him on the fort's parapet. A few hours later the Confederates dumped his body into a mass grave with the bodies of twenty of his men. Although the assault was a failure from a military standpoint, it proved the proposition to which Shaw had reluctantly dedicated himself when he took command of the Fifty-fourth: that black soldiers could indeed be fighting men. By year's end, sixty new black regiments were being organized.A previous selection of Shaw's correspondence was privately published by his family in 1864. For this volume, Russell Duncan has restored many passages omitted from the earlier edition and has provided detailed explanatory notes to the letters. In addition he has written a lengthy biographical essay that places the young colonel and his regiment in historical context.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "1999", "publisher": "University of Georgia Press", "language": "english", "pages": "481", "ISBN10": "0820314595", "ISBN13": "9780820342771", "file": "PDF, 25.43 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1245346", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1245346/b99dfd"},

Hixson", "Robert Bain"], "rating": "0", "description": "John C. Nicolay, who had known Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois, served as chief White House secretary from 1861 to 1865. Trained as a journalist, Nicolay had hoped to write a campaign biography of Lincoln in 1860, a desire that was thwarted when an obscure young writer named William Dean Howells got the job. Years later, however, Nicolay fulfilled his ambition; with John Hay, he spent the years from 1872 to 1890 writing a monumental ten-volume biography of Lincoln.In preparation for this task, Nicolay interviewed men who had known Lincoln both during his years in Springfield and later when he became the president of the United States. \"When it came time to write their massive biography, however,\" Burlingame notes, \"he and Hay made sparing use of the interviews\" because they had become \"skeptical about human memory.\" Nicolay and Hay also feared that Robert Todd Lincoln might censor material that reflected \"poorly on Lincoln or his wife.\"Nicolay had interviewed such Springfield friends as Lincoln\u2019s first two law partners, John Todd Stuart and Stephen T. Logan. At the Illinois capital in June and July 1875, he talked to a number of others including Orville H. Browning, U.S. senator and Lincoln\u2019s close friend and adviser for over thirty-five years, and Ozias M. Hatch, Lincoln\u2019s political ally and Springfield neighbor. Four years later he returned briefly and spoke with John W. Bunn, a young political \"insider\" from Springfield at the time Lincoln was elected president, and once again with Hatch.Browning shed new light on Lincoln\u2019s courtship and marriage, telling Nicolay that Lincoln often told him \"that he was constantly under great apprehension lest his wife should do something which would bring him into disgrace\" while in the White House. During their research, Nicolay and Hay also learned of Lincoln\u2019s despondency and erratic behavior following his rejection by Matilda Edwards, and they were subsequently criticized by friends for suppressing the information. Burlingame argues that this open discussion of Lincoln\u2019s depression of January 1841 is \"perhaps the most startling new information in the Springfield interviews.\"Briefer and more narrowly focused than the Springfield interviews, the Washington interviews deal with the formation of Lincoln\u2019s cabinet, his relations with Congress, his behavior during the war, his humor, and his grief. In a reminiscence by Robert Todd Lincoln, for example, we learn of Lincoln\u2019s despair at General Lee's escape after the Battle of Gettysburg: \"I went into my father\u2019s office ... and found him in [much]\u00a0distress, his head leaning upon the desk in front of him, and when he raised his head there were evidences of tears upon his face. Upon my asking the cause of his distress he told me that he had just received the information that Gen. Lee had succeeded in escaping across the Potomac river. . .\"To supplement these interviews, Burlingame has included Nicolay\u2019s unpublished essays on Lincoln during the 1860 campaign and on Lincoln\u2019s journey from Springfield to Washington in 1861, essay\u2019s based on firsthand testimony.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "1996", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Southern Illinois University Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0809320541", "ISBN13": "9780809320547", "file": "EPUB, 359 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1116094/c24aa2"},

Grant. They were incontestably two of the most important figures in the Civil War, but until now there has been no book about their victorious partnership and the deep friendship that made it possible.They were prewar failures--Grant, forced to resign from the Regular Army because of his drinking, and Sherman, who held four different jobs, including a beloved position at a military academy in the South, during the four years before the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter. But heeding the call to save the Union each struggled past political hurdles to join the war effort. And taking each other's measure at the Battle of Shiloh, ten months into the war, they began their unique collaboration. Often together under fire on the war's great battlefields, they smoked cigars as they gave orders and learned from their mistakes as well as from their shrewd decisions. They shared the demands of family life and the heartache of loss, including the tragic death of Shermans's favorite son. They supported each other in the face of mudslinging criticism by the press and politicians. Their growing mutual admiration and trust, which President Lincoln increasingly relied upon, would set the stage for the crucial final year of the war. While Grant battled with Lee in the campaigns that ended at Appomattox Court House, Sherman first marched through Georgia to Atlanta, and then continued with his epic March to the Sea. Not only did Grant and Sherman come to think alike, but, even though their headquarters at that time were hundreds of miles apart, they were in virtually daily communication strategizing the final moves of the war and planning how to win the peace that would follow.Moving and elegantly written, Grant and Sherman is an historical page turner: a gripping portrait of two men, whose friendship, forged on the battlefield, would win the Civil War.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2005", "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "language": "english", "pages": "480", "ISBN10": "0374166005", "ISBN13": "9780374166007", "file": "EPUB, 1.71 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1280516/6aab61"},

His first taste of combat was in the rugged mountains outside Naples.In October 1943, when most of the 82d departed Italy to prepare for the D-Day invasion of France, Lt. Gen. Mark Clark, the Fifth Army commander, requested that the division\u2019s 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Maggie\u2019s outfit, stay behind for a daring new operation that would outflank the Nazis\u2019 stubborn defensive lines and open the road to Rome. On 22 January 1944, Megellas and the rest of the 504th landed across the beach at Anzio. Following initial success, Fifth Army\u2019s amphibious assault, Operation Shingle, bogged down in the face of heavy German counterattacks that threatened to drive the Allies into the Tyrrhenian Sea. Anzio turned into a fiasco, one of the bloodiest Allied operations of the war. Not until April were the remnants of the regiment withdrawn and shipped to England to recover, reorganize, refit, and train for their next mission.In September, Megellas parachuted into Holland along with the rest of the 82d Airborne as part of another star-crossed mission, Field Marshal Montgomery\u2019s vainglorious Operation Market Garden. Months of hard combat in Holland were followed by the Battle of the Bulge, and the long hard road across Germany to Berlin.Megellas was the most decorated officer of the 82d Airborne Division and saw more action during the war than most. Yet All the Way to Berlin is more than just Maggie\u2019s World War II memoir. Throughout his narrative, he skillfully interweaves stories of the other paratroopers of H Company, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment.

He revolutionized the newspaper industry in America, becoming the most powerful media mogul the world had ever seen, and in the process earned himself the title of \"most hated man in America\" on four different occasions. Now in the second volume of this sweeping biography, Ben Procter gives readers a vivid portrait of the final 40 years of Hearst's life. Drawing on previously unavailable letters and manuscripts, and quoting generously from Hearst's own editorials, Procter covers all aspects of Hearst's career: his journalistic innovations, his impassioned patriotism, his fierce belief in \"Government by Newspaper,\" his frustrated political aspirations, profligate spending and voracious art collecting, the building of his castle at San Simeon, and his tumultuous Hollywood years. The book offers new insight into Hearst's bitter and highly public quarrels with Al Smith (who referred to Hearst papers as \"Mudgutter Gazettes\") and FDR (whose New Deal Hearst dubbed the \"Raw Deal\"); his 30-year affair with the actress Marion Davies (and her own affairs with others); his political evolution from a progressive trust-buster and \"America first\" isolationist to an increasingly conservative and at times hysterical anti-communist. Procter also explores Hearst's ill-considered meeting with Hitler, his attempts to suppress \"Citizen Kane,\" and his relationships with Joseph Kennedy, Charles Lindbergh, Louis B. Meyer, and many other major figures of his time. As Life magazine noted, Hearst newspapers were a \"one-man fireworks display\"--sensational, controversial, informative, and always entertaining. In Ben Procter's fascinating biography, Hearst shines forth in all his eccentric and egocentric glory.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2007", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "352", "ISBN10": "0195325346", "ISBN13": "9781435617629", "file": "PDF, 20.85 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1269126", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1269126/c04282"},

From the streets of Iraq to the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips in the Indian Ocean, and from the mountaintops of Afghanistan to the third floor of Osama Bin Laden\u2019s compound, operator Mark Owen of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group--commonly known as SEAL Team Six-- has been a part of some of the most memorable special operations in history, as well as countless missions that never made headlines.

Instead, it examines civil-military clashes during the war in light of Jacksonian politics and the American citizen-soldier tradition, looking at events that shed light on civilian authority over the military, as well as the far reaching impact of political ambition during this period (specifically, presidential power and the quest for the presidency). By 1848, Americans had come to realize that in their burgeoning democracy, generals and politicians could scarcely resist the temptation to use war for partisan gain. It was a lesson well learned and one that still resonates today.The Mexican War is known for the invaluable experience it provided to future Civil War officers and as an example of America's drive to fulfill her Manifest Destiny. Yet it was more than a training ground, more than a display of imperialism. Significantly, the Mexican War tested civilian control of the military and challenged traditional assumptions about the role of the army in American society. In so doing, it revealed the degree to which, by 1846, the harsh partisanships of the Jacksonian Era had impacted the American approach to war. This is not another chronological retelling of the Mexican War. Instead, it examines civil-military clashes during the war in light of Jacksonian politics and the American citizen-soldier tradition, looking both at events that shed light on civilian authority over the military and at the far reaching impact of political ambition during this period (specifically, presidential power and the quest for the presidency).In addition to politics, a host of others factors marred civil-military relations during the war, threatening U.S. victory. These included atrocities committed by Americans against Mexicans, disobedient officers, and inefficient U.S. military governors. In the end, as Manifest Ambition shows, Polk's ability to overcome his partisan leanings, his micro-management of the war effort, and his overall strategic vision, helped avoid both a prolonged occupation and the annexation of All Mexico. By 1848, Americans had come to realize that in their burgeoning democracy, generals and politicians could scarcely resist the temptation to use war for partisan gain. It was a lesson well learned and one that still resonates today.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2007", "publisher": "Greenwood Publishing Group", "language": "english", "pages": "241", "ISBN10": "0275984095", "ISBN13": "9780275984090", "file": "PDF, 1.29 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1108213", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1108213/8c7d2a"},

Although not as well known in the English-speaking world as Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, S\u00e1nchez played a pivotal role in launching the revolution and administering the revolutionary state. She joined the clandestine 26th of July Movement and went on to choose the landing site of the\u00a0Granma\u00a0and fight with the rebels in the Sierra Maestra. She collected the documents that would form the official archives of the revolution, and, after its victory, launched numerous projects that enriched the lives of many Cubans, from parks to literacy programs to helping develop the Cohiba cigar brand. All the while, she maintained a close relationship with Fidel Castro that lasted until her death in 1980.  The product of ten years of original research, this biography draws on interviews with S\u00e1nchez\u2019s friends, family, and comrades in the rebel army, along with countless letters and documents. Biographer Nancy Stout was initially barred from the official archives, but, in a remarkable twist, was granted access by Fidel Castro himself, impressed as he was with Stout\u2019s project and aware that S\u00e1nchez deserved a worthy biography. This is the extraordinary story of an extraordinary woman who exemplified the very best values of the Cuban Revolution: selfless dedication to the people, courage in the face of grave danger, and the desire to transform society.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Monthly Review Press", "language": "english", "pages": "400", "ISBN10": "1583673172", "ISBN13": "9781583673171", "file": "MOBI , 2.44 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2081567/5d68b1"},

Fonseca, killed in battle in 1976, was the undisputed intellectual and strategic leader of the FSLN. In a groundbreaking and fast-paced narrative that draws on a rich archive of previously unpublished Fonseca writings, Matilde Zimmermann sheds new light on central themes in his ideology as well as on internal disputes, ideological shifts, and personalities of the FSLN.The first researcher ever to be allowed access to Fonseca\u2019s unpublished writings (collected by the Institute for the Study of Sandinism in the early 1980s and now in the hands of the Nicaraguan Army), Zimmermann also obtained personal interviews with Fonseca\u2019s friends, family members, fellow combatants, and political enemies. Unlike previous scholars, Zimmermann sees the Cuban revolution as the crucial turning point in Fonseca\u2019s political evolution. Furthermore, while others have argued that he rejected Marxism in favor of a more pragmatic nationalism, Zimmermann shows how Fonseca\u2019s political writings remained committed to both socialist revolution and national liberation from U.S. imperialism and followed the ideas of both Che Guevara and the earlier Nicaraguan leader Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino. She further argues that his philosophy embracing the experiences of the nation\u2019s workers and peasants was central to the FSLN\u2019s initial platform and charismatic appeal.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2000", "publisher": "Duke University Press Books", "language": "english", "pages": "288 / 289", "ISBN10": "0822325810", "ISBN13": "9780822325819", "file": "PDF, 13.90 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1238731", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1238731/500eef"},

The scarcity of surviving autobiographical material has allowed tellers of his story to fashion a Boone of their own liking, and his myth has evolved in countless stories, biographies, novels, poems, and paintings. In this welcome book, Meredith Mason Brown separates the real Daniel Boone from the many fables that surround him, revealing a man far more complex-and far more interesting-than his legend. Brown traces Boone's life from his Pennsylvania childhood to his experiences in the militia and his rise as an unexcelled woodsman, explorer, and backcountry leader. In the process, we meet the authentic Boone: he didn't wear coonskin caps; he read and wrote better than many frontiersmen; he was not the first to settle Kentucky; he took no pleasure in killing Indians. At once a loner and a leader, a Quaker who became a skilled frontier fighter, Boone is a study in contradictions. Devoted to his wife and children, he nevertheless embarked on long hunts that could keep him from home for two years or more. A captain in colonial Virginia's militia, Boone later fought against the British and their Indian allies in the Revolutionary War before he moved to Missouri when it was still Spanish territory and became a Spanish civil servant. Boone did indeed kill Indians during the bloody fighting for Kentucky, but he also respected Indians, became the adopted son of a Shawnee chief, and formed lasting friendships with many Shawnees who once held him captive.During Boone's lifetime (1734-1820), America evolved from a group of colonies with fewer than a million inhabitants clustered along the Atlantic Coast to an independent nation of close to ten million reaching well beyond the Mississippi River. Frontiersman is the first biography to explore Boone's crucial role in that transformation. Hundreds of thousands of settlers entered Kentucky on the road that Boone and his axemen blazed from the Cumberland Gap to the Kentucky River. Boone's leadership in the defense of Boonesborough during a sustained Indian attack in 1778 was instrumental in preventing white settlers from fleeing Kentucky during the bloody years of the Revolution. And Boone's move to Missouri in 1799 and his exploration up the Missouri River helped encourage a flood of settlers into that region. Through his colorful chronicle of Boone's experiences, Brown paints a rich portrayal of colonial and Revolutionary America, the relations between whites and Indians, the opening and settling of the Old West, and the birth of the American national identity. Supported with copious maps, illustrations, endnotes, and a detailed chronology of Boone's life, Frontiersman provides a fresh and accurate rendering of a man most people know only as a folk hero-and of the nation that has mythologized him for over two centuries.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2008", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "Louisiana State University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "403", "ISBN10": "0807133566", "ISBN13": "9780807133569", "file": "PDF, 3.64 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1113903", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1113903/a931d2"},

Based on research but made practical for today\u2019s leader, The Trust Edge shows that trust is quantifiable and brings dramatic results to businesses and leaders. In this book, Horsager teaches readers how to build the 8 Pillars of Trust: 1. Clarity: People trust the clear and mistrust the ambiguous. 2. Compassion: People put faith in those who care beyond themselves. 3. Character: People notice those who do what is right over what is easy. 4. Competency: People have confidence in those who stay fresh, relevant, and capable. 5. Commitment: People believe in those who stand through adversity. 6. Connection: People want to follow, buy from, and be around friends. 7. Contribution: People immediately respond to results. 8. Consistency: People love to see the little things done consistently. When leaders learn how to implement these pillars, they enjoy better relationships, reputations, retention, revenue, and results. Fascinating and timely, The Trust Edge unveils how trust has the ability to accelerate or destroy any business, organization, or relationship. The lower the trust, the more time everything takes, the more everything costs, and the lower the loyalty of everyone involved. Conversely, an environment of trust leads to greater innovation, morale, and productivity. The trusted leader is followed. From the trusted salesperson, people will buy. For the trusted brand, people will pay more, come back, and tell others.

In the years since then, it has become not only a basic text on the Vietnam War but also a renowned classic in the literature of wars throughout history and, as Caputo explains, of \"the things men do in war and the things war does to men.\" \"A singular and marvelous work.\" --The New York Times", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "1996", "edition": "First Owl Books Edition", "publisher": "Henry Holt and Co.", "language": "english", "pages": "417", "ISBN10": "080504695X", "ISBN13": "9780805046953", "file": "PDF, 18.68 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

In and out of government, in and out of exile, but consistent in her commitment to Liberia, Sirleaf in her memoir reveals herself to be among the most resilient, determined and courageous as well. She writes with modesty in a calm and measured tone. While her account includes a happy childhood and an unhappy marriage, the book is politically, not personally, focused as she (and Liberia) go through the disastrous presidencies of Samuel Doe and Charles Taylor. Sirleaf's training as an economist and her employment (e.g., in banking, as minister of finance in Liberia, and in U.N. development programs) informs the perspective from which she views internal Liberian history (e.g., the tensions between the settler class and the indigenous people) and Liberia's international relations. Although her focus is thoroughly on Liberia, the content is more widely instructive, particularly her account of the role of the Economic Community of West African States. *(Apr.)*    Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From Booklist  Africa\u2019s first elected female president, Sirleaf chronicles her rise from an abused young wife and mother to a woman with a career in government finance and international banking to the president of Liberia since 2006. Sirleaf confronted corruption and incompetence through several Liberian governments and\u00a0suffered imprisonment and exile for her controversial positions before ultimately returning and challenging the long and troubled history of her nation. Liberia was created by the U.S. to repatriate former slaves, creating a tension between Americo-Liberians and indigenous peoples that continues. She recounts her struggles at home and abroad;\u00a0she watched dictator Samuel Doe and later Charles Taylor destroy Liberia while\u00a0she continued to criticize\u00a0U.S. involvement with corrupt regimes. Having no colonial power to overcome, Sirleaf\u00a0contends that Liberia has often struggled to develop and maintain a sense of true national integration, something she has sought to achieve as she has worked to bring economic and social stability to her civil-war-torn nation.

The author provides a detailed look at the unique trench culture of the British 1st Army and analyzes \"lessons learned,\" such as the proper deployment of massed artillery and infantry reserves during that bloody year. Her assessment of Allied strategy and tactics is unparalleled in clarity. Her statistics further dramatize the loss of life on the Western Front in 1915 (Macdonald regards Gallipoli as an extension of the Western Front): Of the 19,500 square miles of German-occupied territory fought over, only eight were recovered-an average of 200,000 casualties per mile. Macdonald's vividly rendered history evokes pity and awe at the slaughter. By Christmas 1915, she notes, there was still some hope of ending the conflict quickly, but it was no longer the hope of innocent optimism. Photos.    Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.    From Library Journal  Macdonald presents a history of the second year of the Great War, focusing almost entirely on the impressions and experiences of common soldiers gathered from interviews over the last 20 years as well as from letters, journals, and memoirs. The author has chosen not to analyze Loos, Ypres, Neuve Chappelle, and the introduction of gas warfare in detail but rather to set the scene and let the desperate, patriotic, idealistic soldiers tell in their own words how those qualities were expunged and the desire merely to survive left in their place. The book is not a replacement for a general history, but Macdonald's considerable skill in weaving her narrative makes this an excellent addition to the literature. However, this is Macdonald's fourth compilations of World War I material; libraries holding the others may consider this one more than they need.   *Edwin B.

At the time, Julian said: 'I hope this book will become one of the unifying documents of our generation. In this highly personal work, I explain our global struggle to force a new relationship between the people and their governments.'  In the end, the work was to prove too personal. Despite sitting for more than fifty hours of taped interviews and spending many late nights at Ellingham Hall (where he was living under house arrest) discussing his life and the work of WikiLeaks with the writer he had enlisted to help him, Julian became increasingly troubled by the thought of publishing an autobiography. After reading the first draft of the book at the end of March, Julian declared: 'All memoir is prostitution.' In June 2011, with thirty-eight publishing houses around the world committed to releasing the book, Julian told us he wanted to cancel his contract.  We disagree with Julian's assessment of the book. We believe it explains both the man and his work, underlining his commitment to the truth.  Julian always claimed the book was well written; we agree, and this also encouraged us to make the book available to readers. And the contract? By the time Julian wanted to cancel the deal he had already used the advance money to settle his legal bills. So the contract still stands. We have decided to honour it - and to publish.

Kurt Piehler, author of \"Remembering War the American Way\" and Associate Professor of History, The University of Tennessee1858 explores the events and personalities of the year that would send the America's North and South on a collision course culminating in the slaughter of 630,000 of the nation's young men, a greater number than died in any other American conflict. The record of that year is told in seven separate stories, each participant, though unaware, is linked to the oncoming tragedy by the central, though ineffective, figure of that time, the man in the White House, President James Buchanan. The seven figures who suddenly leap onto history's stage and shape the great moments to come are: Jefferson Davis, who lived a life out of a Romantic novel, and who almost died from herpes simplex of the eye; the disgruntled Col. Robert E. Lee, who had to decide whether he would stay in the military or return to Virginia to run his family's plantation; William Tecumseh Sherman, one of the great Union generals, who had been reduced to running a roadside food stand in Kansas; the uprising of eight abolitionists in Oberlin, Ohio, who freed a slave apprehended by slave catchers, and set off a fiery debate across America; a dramatic speech by New York Senator William Seward in Rochester, which foreshadowed the civil war and which seemed to solidify his hold on the 1860 Republican Presidential nomination; John Brown's raid on a plantation in Missouri, where he freed several slaves, and marched them eleven hundred miles to Canada, to be followed a year later by his catastrophic attack on Harper's Ferry; and finally, Illinois Senator Steven Douglas' seven historic debates with little-known Abraham Lincoln in the Illinois Senate race, that would help bring the ambitious and determined Lincoln to the Presidency of the United States.

Ed D. Jennings, who simply wanted clarification of his status, writes: \"Some Reckon and others guess But what I wish to know is this, what do you mean to do with us Col[ore]d population are we to suffer and our enemies reap or can we Reap now I was brought up a farmer and if I can have a hut in my own native land and a little help that will suffice me.\"\"At a single reading,\" Holzer notes in his preface, Lincoln\u2019s staff \"might handle: requests for political appointments (they might come from an ex-President, a New York archbishop, even Lincoln\u2019s own minister); suggestions for how better to manage the war; requests for autographs, locks of hair, and personal appearances; presumptuous political advice; rhymes, hymns, epistles\u2014and on one occasion, sixteen pages of vicious abuse in verse\u2014from amateur poets; and gifts and tokens that included food, drink, clothing, pictures, and sculptures.\"Holzer has rescued these voices\u2014sometimes eloquent, occasionally angry, often poignant, at times poetic\u2014from the obscurity of the archives of the Civil War. The letters, of course, speak for themselves, but Holzer\u2019s introduction and annotations provide historical context for events and people described as well as for those who wrote so passionately to their president in Lincoln\u2019s America.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "1998", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "SIU Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "080932072X", "ISBN13": "9780809320721", "file": "EPUB, 867 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1116097/5dbefe"},

From that day through the execution of four of the accomplices, the Pennsylvania-born general held responsibility for the most notorious prisoners in American history. A strict adherent to protocol, Hartranft kept a meticulously detailed account of his experiences in the form of a letterbook. In The Lincoln Assassination Conspirators, noted Lincoln scholars Edward Steers, Jr., and Harold Holzer, in partnership with the National Archives, present this fascinating historical record for the first time with contextual materials and expert annotations, providing a remarkable glimpse behind the scenes of the assassination's aftermath.     Hartranft oversaw every aspect of the prisoners' daily lives, from making sure they were fed and kept clean to ensuring that no one communicated with them except on the written orders of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. In his Letterbook, Hartranft scrupulously recounts the arrival of each prisoner and describes the prison routine--which included three simple meals a day, a twice-daily cell inspection by Hartranft himself, and frequent physical examinations by an army physician. The prisoners wore wrist and leg shackles and, controversially, most of them wore special hoods designed to isolate them from their surroundings.     When the conspirators' trial began, the nation waited eagerly for news, and many sought retribution against those they held responsible for the nation's grief. Hartranft resisted calls for both vengeance and mercy and continued to treat his notorious charges as humanely as possible, facilitating meetings with clergy and sending letters to and from family members. Yet, as his detached, detailed description of the execution of four of the conspirators shows, he did not allow emotion to impede the performance of his duty.     The legal and moral issues surrounding the conspirators' trial--the extraordinary use of military rather than civil justice, the treatment of the accused while incarcerated, the fine line between swift and precipitous justice--remain volatile, unsettled issues today. Hartranft's keen observations, ably analyzed by historians Steers and Holzer, will add a riveting new chapter to the story of Lincoln's assassination.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2009", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "Louisiana State University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "207", "ISBN10": "0807133965", "ISBN13": "9780807133965", "file": "PDF, 2.96 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/889667", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/889667/86c2ad"},

Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader known to be ensconced in a Taliban stronghold surrounded by a small but heavily armed force. Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive.      This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history. But it is also, more than anything, the story of his teammates, who fought ferociously beside him until he was the last one left-blasted unconscious by a rocket grenade, blown over a cliff, but still armed and still breathing. Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers. A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow-by-blow, through the brutal training of America's warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks. In this rich , moving chronicle of courage, honor, and patriotism, Marcus Luttrell delivers one of the most powerful narratives ever written about modern warfare-and a tribute to his teammates, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Little, Brown and Company", "language": "english", "pages": "390", "ISBN10": "0316067598", "ISBN13": "9780316067591", "file": "MOBI , 4.80 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2216342/eae084"},

Villa legends pervade not only Mexico but the United States and beyond, existing not only in the popular mind and tradition but in ballads and movies. There are legends of Villa the Robin Hood, Villa the womanizer, and Villa as the only foreigner who has attacked the mainland of the United States since the War of 1812 and gotten away with it.Whether exaggerated or true to life, these legends have resulted in Pancho Villa the leader obscuring his revolutionary movement, and the myth in turn obscuring the leader. Based on decades of research in the archives of seven countries, this definitive study of Villa aims to separate myth from history. So much attention has focused on Villa himself that the characteristics of his movement, which is unique in Latin American history and in some ways unique among twentieth-century revolutions, have been forgotten or neglected. Villa\u2019s Divisi?n del Norte was probably the largest revolutionary army that Latin America ever produced. Moreover, this was one of the few revolutionary movements with which a U.S. administration attempted, not only to come to terms, but even to forge an alliance. In contrast to Lenin, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and Fidel Castro, Villa came from the lower classes of society, had little education, and organized no political party.The first part of the book deals with Villa\u2019s early life as an outlaw and his emergence as a secondary leader of the Mexican Revolution, and also discusses the special conditions that transformed the state of Chihuahua into a leading center of revolution. In the second part, beginning in 1913, Villa emerges as a national leader. The author analyzes the nature of his revolutionary movement and the impact of Villismo as an ideology and as a social movement. The third part of the book deals with the years 1915 to 1920: Villa\u2019s guerrilla warfare, his attack on Columbus, New Mexico, and his subsequent decline. The last part describes Villa\u2019s surrender, his brief life as a hacendado, his assassination and its aftermath, and the evolution of the Villa legend. The book concludes with an assessment of Villa\u2019s personality and the character and impact of his movement.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "1998", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Stanford University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "1014 / 1015", "ISBN10": "0804730466", "ISBN13": "9780804730464", "file": "PDF, 135.07 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1210401", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1210401/81419b"},

Morrow", "Jean Edward Smith"], "rating": "0", "description": "In his magisterial bestseller FDR, Jean Edward Smith gave us a fresh, modern look at one of the most indelible figures in American history. Now this peerless biographer returns with a new life of Dwight D. Eisenhower that is as full, rich, and revealing as anything ever written about America\u2019s thirty-fourth president. As America searches for new heroes to lead it out of its present-day predicaments, Jean Edward Smith\u2019s achievement lies in reintroducing us to a hero from the past whose virtues have become clouded in the mists of history. Here is Eisenhower the young dreamer, charting a course from Abilene, Kansas, to West Point, to Paris under Pershing, and beyond. Drawing on a wealth of untapped primary sources, Smith provides new insight into Ike\u2019s maddening apprenticeship under Douglas MacArthur in Washington and the Philippines. Then the whole panorama of World War II unfolds, with Eisenhower\u2019s superlative generalship forging the Allied path to victory through multiple reversals of fortune in North Africa and Italy, culminating in the triumphant invasion of Normandy. Smith also gives us an intriguing examination of Ike\u2019s finances, details his wartime affair with Kay Summersby, and reveals the inside story of the 1952 Republican convention that catapulted him to the White House.Smith\u2019s chronicle of Eisenhower\u2019s presidential years is as compelling as it is comprehensive. Derided by his detractors as a somnambulant caretaker, Eisenhower emerges in Smith\u2019s perceptive retelling as both a canny politician and a skillful, decisive leader. Smith convincingly portrays an Eisenhower who engineered an end to America\u2019s three-year no-win war in Korea, resisted calls for preventative wars against the Soviet Union and China, and boldly deployed the Seventh Fleet to protect Formosa from invasion. This Eisenhower, Smith shows us, stared down Khrushchev over Berlin and forced the withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli forces from the Suez Canal. He managed not only to keep the peace\u2014after Ike made peace in Korea, not one American soldier was killed in action during his tenure\u2014but also to enhance America\u2019s prestige in the Middle East and throughout the world.Domestically, Eisenhower reduced defense spending, balanced the budget, constructed the interstate highway system, and provided social security coverage for millions who were self-employed. Ike believed that traditional American values encompassed change and progress.Unmatched in insight, Eisenhower in War and Peace at last gives us an Eisenhower for our time\u2014and for the ages.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2012", "edition": "1st Printing", "publisher": "Random House", "language": "english", "pages": "976", "ISBN10": "140006693X", "ISBN13": "9781400066933", "file": "MOBI , 5.49 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2039617/7dacec"},

What lay behind his obsessive hunger for power and control, his paranoid attacks against enemies real and perceived, his refusal to accept defeat? Why did a man who had achieved so much feel so unfulfilled even at the height of his power? And what drove the president responsible for such triumphs as the opening of relations with China to the depths of the most devastating political scandal in American history? Richard Nixon: A Psychobiography is the first thoroughgoing psychological portrait of the 37th president, drawing upon telling interviews with Nixon intimates, published and archived materials, while employing a rigorous psychoanalytic methodology. Tracing the development of Nixon's complex psyche, the authors provide new insight not only into his unconscious motivations but also into the way they influenced his political actions, whether shrewd or disastrous.The authors explore Nixon's difficult upbringing -- his mean-spirited, abusive father and often-absent mother; episodic physical trauma and mental deprivation; the tragic deaths of his two brothers; his rejection by the first woman he hoped to marry; and the long pursuit of his eventual wife, Pat. Nixon emerges as a narcissistic man with an extraordinary sense of purpose, yet one who suffered from inner conflicts and self-destructive tendencies. His desire to heal difficult political conflicts and his need to punish himself continually were attempts to reconcile the crippling contradiction between a grandiose self image and an impoverished private sense of worth. Projecting his own devalued self image onto others, attempting to control and destroy them, Nixon surrendered to the excessive suspiciousness that would eventually lead to his downfall.Here are the three faces of Nixon's complex psyche -- the grandiose persona, which manifested itself in bold policy moves like \"The New Federalism\" and the China initiative; the peacemaker, whose desire to heal internal conflicts can be seen in the policies of d?tente and the \"Southern\" desegregation strategy; and the paranoid degraded self, which struck out against those who had humiliated him and was responsible for the bombing of Cambodia and the Watergate break-in.This probing analysis makes intelligible the moments in Nixon's presidency that have provoked much speculation but few answers, from his attempt to talk to Vietnam war protesters during a pre-dawn visit to the Lincoln Memorial to his keeping of the White House tapes. A more nuanced, more humanized Nixon emerges in a book that also provides compelling evidence that the politics of a nation is subject to the unconscious needs, fears, and fantasies of its leaders.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "1999", "publisher": "Columbia University Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0231108559", "ISBN13": "9780585383750", "file": "EPUB, 340 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1066496/54dad7"},

Young Castro challenges us to put aside the caricature of a bearded, cigar-munching, anti-American hothead to discover how Castro became the dictator who acted as a thorn in the side of US presidents for nearly half a century.\n\r\nIn this \u201cgripping and edifying narrative\u2026Hansen brings imposing research and notable erudition\u201d (Booklist) to Castro\u2019s early life, showing Castro getting his toughness from a father who survived Spain\u2019s class system and colonial wars to become one of the most successful independent plantation owners in Cuba. We see a boy running around that plantation more comfortable playing with the children of his father\u2019s laborers than his own classmates at elite boarding schools in Santiago de Cuba and Havana. We discover a young man who writes flowery love letters from prison and contemplates the meaning of life, a gregarious soul attentive to the needs of strangers but often indifferent to the needs of his own family. These pages show a liberal democrat who admires FDR\u2019s New Deal policies and is skeptical of communism, but is also hostile to American imperialism. They show an audacious militant who stages a reckless attack on a military barracks but is canny about building an army of resisters. In short, Young Castro reveals a complex man.\n\r\nThe first American historian in a generation to gain access to the Castro archives in Havana, Jonathan Hansen was able to secure cooperation from Castro\u2019s family and closest confidants. He gained access to hundreds of never-before-seen letters and interviewed people he was the first to ask for their impressions of the man. The result is a nuanced and penetrating portrait of a man at once brilliant, arrogant, bold, vulnerable, and all too human: a man who, having grown up on an island that felt like a colonial cage, was compelled to lead his country to independence.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2020", "edition": "Reprint", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "language": "english", "pages": "512", "ISBN10": "1476732485", "ISBN13": "9781476732480", "file": "EPUB, 5.93 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5652605/d31ee0"},

KENNEDY. SHE CALLED HIM MR. HILL. For four years, from the election of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in November 1960 until after the election of Lyndon Johnson in 1964, Clint Hill was the Secret Service agent assigned to guard the glamorous and intensely private Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. During those four years, he went from being a reluctant guardian to a fiercely loyal watchdog and, in many ways, her closest friend. Now, looking back fifty years, Clint Hill tells his story for the first time, offering a tender, enthralling, and tragic portrayal of how a Secret Service agent who started life in a North Dakota orphanage became the most trusted man in the life of the First Lady who captivated first the nation and then the world. When he was initially assigned to the new First Lady, Agent Hill envisioned tea parties and gray-haired matrons. But as soon as he met her, he was swept up in the whirlwind of her beauty, her grace, her intelligence, her coy humor, her magnificent composure, and her extraordinary spirit. From the start, the job was like no other, and Clint was by her side through the early days of JFK's presidency; the birth of sons John and Patrick and Patrick's sudden death; Kennedy-family holidays in Hyannis Port and Palm Beach; Jackie's trips to Europe, Asia, and South America; Jackie's intriguing meetings with men like Aristotle Onassis, Gianni Agnelli, and Andr\u00e9 Malraux; the dark days of the year that followed the assassination to the farewell party she threw for Clint when he left her protective detail after four years. All she wanted was the one thing he could not give her: a private life for her and her children. Filled with unforgettable details, startling revelations, and sparkling, intimate moments, this is the once-in-a-lifetime story of a man doing the most exciting job in the world, with a woman all the world loved, and the tragedy that ended it all too soon\u2014 a tragedy that haunted him for fifty years.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Gallery Books", "language": "english", "pages": "352", "ISBN10": "1451648448", "ISBN13": "9781451648447", "file": "EPUB, 4.22 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2210257/46eab3"},

The complete three-volume  work is composed of:    Excellent Buddhism    Profound Buddhism    Secret Buddhism    The first volume, Excellent Buddhism, contains a number of  biographical documents on Kalu Rinpoche, notably the remarkable  memories of Lama Gyaltsen. The first volume also contains  teachings dealing more specifically with daily life and with the  relationship between Buddhism and the West.     The second volume, Profound Buddhism, presents the teachings on  Hinayana and Mahayana as esoteric aspects of Buddhism. Profound  Buddhism expounds on the absolute nature of mind, emptiness, and  compassion; dealing with conflicting emotions; the situation of  the individual in the cycle of existence; and karma. Finally, the  third volume, Secret Buddhism, reveals the principles of  Vajrayana, mantras, empowerments, the six yogas of Naropa, and so  on. It includes important chapters on the bardo (the period of  time between death and rebirth), Tibetan medicine, and initiation  lineages.    Kalu Rinpoche, Lama of Light, came to France for the first time  in 1971. Tibet, an inaccessible stronghold of highest  spirituality, had remained separate up to this time, on the  grounds that the rest of the world could not understand her. Kalu  Rinpoche, then almost 70 years old, was the first, despite the  skepticism of the majority of his peers, to believe that Tibetan  Buddhism could have an impact in the West.    History proved that he was right. He taught many people during  numerous trips until his death in 1989. A great number of them  were captivated by his charismatic radiance and set out on the  path of liberation. Kalu Rinpoche is no longer with us, but the  wealth, depth, and diversity of his recorded teachings remain.    Unfortunately, these recordings are not accessible to the public.  Not only is the lamp kept in the dark, but this treasury runs the  risk of becoming lost. Reflecting on this situation, Lama  Gyaltsen, who was for 40 years Rinpoche's servant and then his  secretary, asked us to collect and edit all the available  teachings of Kalu Rinpoche.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Political", "year": "1995", "publisher": "Clearpoint Pr", "language": "english", "pages": "176 / 180", "ISBN10": "0963037145", "ISBN13": "9780963037145", "file": "PDF, 9.92 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1293600", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1293600/8c8c6d"},

This book provides more than just a biography of a great leader; it enables readers to understand who Zapata was and the interests and ideologies he supported, emphasizing his ideals and distinguishing him from those who have used his name for their own purposes. Emiliano Zapata: A Biography is organized chronologically, detailing Zapata's youth and early adulthood in the years preceding the Mexican Revolution; his role in getting his home state involved in the Revolution; and his ascent to power in Morelos' revolutionary movement. The author elucidates Zapata's continual struggle to bring meaningful change to the lives of Mexico's poorest people, how his commitment to revolutionary reform came to define his existence, and how his ideals led to his own violent death as they had to the deaths of so many of his adversaries.

Ultimately, they were the only Jewish children of the town to survive the Holocaust. A Guest in My Own Country recalls the life of one of Eastern Europe's most accomplished modern writers, beginning with his survival during the final months of the war. Konr?d captures the dangers, the hopes, the betrayals and courageous acts of the period through a series of carefully chosen episodes that occasionally border on the surreal (as when a dead German soldier begins to speak, attempting to justify his actions).The end of the war launches the young man on a remarkable career in letters and politics. Offering lively descriptions of both his private and public life in Budapest, New York, and Berlin, Konr?d reflects insightfully on his role in the Hungarian Uprising, the notion of \"internal emigration\"\u2014the fate of many writers who, like Konr?d, refused to leave the Eastern Bloc under socialism\u2014and other complexities of European identity.

Dr. David Gushee offers a powerful, inspiring message of hope and healing by helping Christians to return to Bible study, prayer, and reflection in a way that creates a vision for a more inclusive church.\u00a0Arguably America's leading Christian ethicist, Gushee has written many helpful books for churches, discussion groups, and individuals. He is the author of the \"Evangelical Declaration Against Torture\" and drafted the \"Evangelical Climate Initiative.\" His\u00a0Kingdom Ethics\u00a0is on pastors' bookshelves nationwide. Now, in what he describes as the most important book of his career as a Christian teacher, Gushee gives us this encouraging discussion on how he changed his mind.\u00a0From his own careful Bible study, research, and prayer, Gushee takes us along an conversational theological journey. In one book, he concisely marks out every single component of historic Christian sexual morality. He covers all of the relevant biblical passages and all the theological positions, including the key argument of creation. With a careful study of context and biblical language, he walks us through a principled discussion that is respectful of traditionalists while calling for inclusion and the end of contempt. This definitive third edition also includes Gushee's response to critics and a study guide for small group discussion.Author Brian McLaren calls\u00a0Changing Our Mind\u00a0\"deep, thoughtful and brilliant . . . [and] refreshingly clear and understandable.\" It is an eminently useful handbook for any individual or organization that wants to better contextualize traditional church teachings, which have been and must continue to change.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Religious", "year": "2015", "edition": "3rd", "publisher": "David Crumm Media, LLC", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9781942011866", "file": "EPUB, 915 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16568076/55ed56"},

Everyone knows someone who suffers from anxiety, depression, or another form of mental illness, but a stigma around mental health remains--especially in the church. Ryan Casey Waller--pastor, therapist, and cosufferer--has experienced firsthand the jarring dissonance of wrestling with mental health while trying to maintain a vibrant Christian faith. It can be a discouraging, lonely battle. But it doesn't have to be. In this book, Waller emphasizes that mental health issues are not a symptom of a spiritual failing or insufficient faith; rather, suffering is the very thing our Savior seeks to heal as he leads us toward restoration. Combining practical theology, clinical insights, and deep compassion, Waller invites readers to see why we need conversations in the church about mental health and how to have them; discover why seeking knowledge about one's self is critical to growing deeper in relationship with God; understand the basics of brain health, the intersection of biology and spirituality, and why emotional intelligence deserves more attention; learn practical steps such as how to find a therapist, distinguish between a psychiatrist and a psychologist, and afford treatment; and become equipped to support loved ones with mental illness while promoting healthy self-care.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Religious", "year": "2021", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Thomas Nelson", "language": "english", "pages": "254", "ISBN13": "9781400221332", "file": "EPUB, 1.00 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/11187960/2bfe26"},

Dalam buku ini, Karen Armstrong menunjukkan pembelaan terhadap Tuhan dan agama menentang fundamentalisme dan ateisme. Di berbagai penjuru dunia, kita melihat agama-agama sedang mengalami kebangkitan. Dampaknya terasa di berbagai bidang: politik, sosial, dan ekonomi. Namun, pada saat yang sama, skeptisisme dan nihilisme terhadap Tuhan dan agama pun terasa meningkat sebagai respons terhadap perkembangan itu. Dalam buku ini, Karen Armstrong tampil lebih tegas mendukung agama dari serangan bertubi-tubi fundamentalisme maupun pemikir ateisme semacam Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, dan Sam Harris. Karen Armstrong memperlihatkan kesejajaran antara ateisme gaya-Dawkins dan fundamentalisme kontemporer. Dengan nada optimisme spiritual yang tenang, Karen Armstrong menyajikan gambaran menggairahkan tentang masa depan agama-agama.

Billions of dollars mysteriously vanish into thin air? A building rock when its resonant frequency matches a gym class leaping to Snap's 1990 hit I've Got The Power? The answer is maths. Or, to be precise, what happens when maths goes wrong in the real world. As Matt Parker shows us, our modern lives are built on maths: computer programmes, finance, engineering. And most of the time this maths works quietly behind the scenes, until ... it doesn't. Exploring and explaining a litany of glitches, near-misses and mishaps involving the internet, big data, elections, street signs, lotteries, the Roman empire and a hapless Olympic shooting team, Matt Parker shows us the bizarre ways maths trips us up, and what this reveals about its essential place in our world. Mathematics doesn't have good 'people skills', but we would all be better off, he argues, if we saw it as a practical ally. This book shows how, by making maths our friend, we can learn from its pitfalls. It also contains puzzles, challenges, geometric socks, jokes about binary code and three deliberate mistakes.

What had Stengel ever done? His work managing the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves had been long on personality and remarkably short on success. They thought the Yankees would never be able to compete with the Red Sox or Indians with that broken-down old man in charge. At the All-Star break, the Yankees looked like a banged-up bunch of also-rans, not like a team about to embark on five straight championships. Yet Stengel seemed confident of success. As Steven Goldman explains, people had forgotten that Casey knew how to come back.    How did he know? Goldman refutes claims that anyone could have won with the Yankees. Casey knew how to win because of the years of struggle and ignominy, because he\u2019d learned how to manage by running two of the game\u2019s worst sad-sack franchises, because he had learned through failure. To understand Stengel\u2019s formative years, Goldman retraces Stengel\u2019s baseball education in playing for the great John McGraw, from whom he also learned that success permits no room for nostalgia. Goldman follows Stengel through his years with the Dodgers and Braves, his return to the minors, a spat with Bill Veeck, and his success as a businessman away from the diamond.    Forging Genius gives insights to Stengel\u2019s irrepressible love of the game and his incorrigible desire to entertain. As Casey put it, \"Because I can make people laugh, some of them think I\u2019m a damn fool.\" His humor camouflaged a relentless hunger for success, glory, and the respectability he desperately sought. Goldman gives readers an unprecedented vision of one man\u2019s lifelong pursuit of genius on the baseball diamond.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2005", "language": "english", "pages": "316 / 324", "ISBN10": "1574888730", "ISBN13": "9781429485999", "file": "PDF, 6.29 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/914454", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/914454/c27d16"},

True, in a mere twelve years, his \"Fighting Irish\" won 105 games, including five astonishing undefeated seasons. But Rockne was more than the sum of his victories--he was an icon, a legend on a par with Babe Ruth, a sports giant who, more than anyone, made football an American obsession.     In Rockne of Notre Dame, Ray Robinson delivers a memorable portrait of one of the great American sports figures. The book gives us colorful descriptions of such Rockne teams as the undefeated 1924 eleven led by the illustrious Four Horsemen, and the 1930 squad, Rockne's last and greatest.  Here too are vivid accounts of some of the great games in Notre Dame history, including epic battles with arch rivals Army, Nebraska, Carnegie Tech, and USC. But the heart of the book is Rockne himself. A renowned motivator whose \"Win one for the Gipper\" is the most famous locker-room speech ever, Rockne was also football's most brilliant innovator, a pioneer of the forward pass, a master of the psychological ploy, and an early advocate of conditioning.  Though Robinson doesn't pull punches, Rockne emerges as an exemplary and complex figure, a fierce competitor who was generous in victory and defeat, an inspiring father figure to his players, and a man so revered nationwide that when he died in a plane crash in 1931, at the height of his career, he was mourned by the entire country.       A feast for all Notre Dame grads and for subway alumni everywhere, this engaging biography is the finest portrait we have of the man who changed football in America.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "1999", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "305", "ISBN10": "0788197339", "ISBN13": "9780788197338", "file": "PDF, 15.67 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1083802", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1083802/072b6f"},

Aaron Fisher was a eager and spirited eleven-year-old when legendary Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky recruited him into his Second Mile children\u2019s charity. Offering support at a critical time in Aaron\u2019s life, Sandusky gave him gifts and attention, winning the boy\u2019s trust even as he isolated him from his family and peers. Before long, Sandusky\u2019s attention escalated into sexual assault. When Aaron summoned the courage to speak up, he found himself ostracized and harassed by the very people who were supposed to protect him. The investigation set off by his coming forward would drag on for three years\u2014and would launch the biggest scandal in the history of sports.  In Silent No More, Aaron Fisher recounts his harrowing quest to bring Sandusky\u2019s crimes to light\u2014from the intense feelings of guilt that kept him from speaking up earlier and the fear he felt at accusing a man who was a pillar of the community and a hero to the largest alumni network in the world, to the infuriating delays in the arrest and conviction of his abuser. He catalogs the devastating personal toll the case took on him: the shattered relationships, panic attacks, and betrayal of trust that continued to haunt him even after the charges went public in the fall of 2011. But he also speaks of his mother\u2019s desperate efforts to get him out of harm\u2019s way, the invaluable help of psychologist Michael Gillum, and the vindication he felt at inspiring numerous other victims to step forward . . . and at knowing that, thanks to him, there would be no future victims of Jerry Sandusky.  In the end, Aaron Fisher won his fight to expose the truth, achieving some measure of closure. Told in the honest and unforgettable voices of Aaron; his mother, Dawn; and his psychologist, Mike, this inspiring book completes Aaron\u2019s transformation from a nameless casualty into a resounding voice for change.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Ballantine Books", "language": "english", "pages": "240", "ISBN10": "0345544161", "ISBN13": "9780345544162", "file": "EPUB, 1.18 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2208307/ac7fb9"},

This book picks up where the earlier book ended\u2014with Jericho in 1999 joining Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Enterprise, the most important venue in wresting\u2014and ends with Jericho's return to the ring in 2007 after a two-year retirement. Jericho hilariously details these key years as WWE's resident bad guy. His feuds with WWE's colorful (and colorfully profane) cast, including the likes of X-Pac, Ken Shamrock, Chyna, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, and Christian, are solidly recounted, although most of this will be old news to hardcore WWE fans. But the most interesting stories involve his battles on- and off-stage with such better-known stars as Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Goldberg\u2014whom Jericho once had run over by a limousine during an episode of WWE's Raw series.

Scampy, as he is affectionately known has had a long and storied career as a linesman in the NHL. His 5-foot-7 frame and 163 pounds belie his ability and endurance on the ice. When Ray retired in 2004 after 33 years in the NHL, he had officiated in 2,500 regular season matches (never missing a game), 426 playoff games, and an astounding twenty Stanley Cup final series. His untouchable statistics make him a lock to enter the Hockey Hall of Fame as an official, but even they do not do justice to the respect he has earned from officials, players, coaches, and fans alike. On and off the ice, Scampy is considered one of hockey's great personalities, a consummate professional, a chronic practical joker, and a true ambassador of the sport.Between the Lines gives a rare glimpse inside the world of hockey from an unusual perspective \u2014 through the eyes of one of the game's greatest and best-loved officials. Scampy shares his tales of life both on and off the ice as an official, an inside look at what those players and coaches are really like, what they really say and do, and what the game looks like between the lines. Full of fun stories, perspective on how the game has changed and evolved, and stories and interviews about Scampy from players, coaches, and other officials, Between the Lines is a captivating memoir of a truly unique life in hockey.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2006", "edition": "1", "language": "english", "pages": "288 / 289", "ISBN10": "0470838345", "ISBN13": "9780470158418", "file": "PDF, 1.06 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/886667", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/886667/2f3f92"},

In singling out his many innovative contributions to the development of intercollegiate football, this book attempts to present a true picture of Heisman as both man and coach.

For countless fans of professional wrestling and mixed martial arts, Brock Lesnar has long been known for his freakish athleticism, mind-blowing speed, and meteoric rise to the top. Yet despite the fame and fortune that have come with his enormous success, Brock has shunned the media, choosing instead to remain intensely private about his life and his accomplishments.   Now, for the first time, he tells his remarkable story in his own words, describing the journey from his South Dakota farmboy roots to becoming the most popular pay-per-view attraction in the world. From the small-town amateur wrestling where he honed his skills to taking on The Rock at SummerSlam, Brock discusses how his natural athletic talent combined with the dark side of the wrestling business to make him the youngest-ever WWE World Champion.   Epic as it was, Brock's overnight rise to fame came with a price, as he saw firsthand the toll that life on the road and in the ring could take on a pro wrestler's body and mind. Weary of the punishing lifestyle and backstabbing politics, he chose to do the unthinkable: walk away from professional wrestling at the peak of his career and break all ties with the organization that made him a star on the global stage. It was a move that stunned WWE executives and fans alike, and one that Brock himself has never fully explained\u2014until now.   Not one to stay quiet for long, Brock was soon back in the spotlight: this time in the UFC\u2014home of the most dangerous mixed martial arts fighters in the world. Here he offers a behind-the-scenes look at his shocking decision to leave the wrestling entertainment business for a legitimate combat sport. From training to be a real fighter, to immediately being thrown into the Octagon against the UFC's best heavyweights, to the psychology behind his legendary trash-talking, Brock opens up about what it takes not only to succeed in the world's fastest-growing sport but to become the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World. He also speaks candidly about the illness that nearly killed him, how it changed him as a fighter and a man, and how it shaped his will to survive.   In the end, Brock holds nothing back. A revealing, raw, and ultimately redemptive tale of Brock's determination and domination, DeathClutch is the untold true story of becoming one of life's true champions.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2011", "publisher": "HarperCollins", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9780062023124", "file": "MOBI , 1.51 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1231967/d461ff"},

Yet for all his accomplishments, Cy  Young remains to most baseball fans a legendary but little known  figure.    In this book, Reed Browning re-creates the life of Denton True  \"Cyclone\" Young and places his story in the context of a rapidly  changing turn-of-the-century America. Born in rural Ohio, the son of a  Civil War veteran, Young learned his trade at a time when only  underhand pitching was permitted. When he began his professional  career in 1890, pitchers wore no gloves and stood five feet closer to  the batter than they do today. By the time he retired in 1911, the  game of baseball had evolved into its modern form and claimed  unquestioned status as America's \"national pastime.\"    As Browning shows, Young's extraordinary mastery of his craft owed  much to his ability to adapt to the changing nature of the  game. Endowed with an exceptional fastball, he gradually developed a  wide array of deliveries and pitches-all of which he could throw with  astonishing control. Yet his success can also be attributed, at least  in part, to the rustic values of loyalty, hard work, and fair play  that he embraced and embodied, and for which he became renowned among  baseball fans of his day.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2000", "publisher": "University of Massachusetts Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "1558492623", "ISBN13": "9781558492622", "file": "EPUB, 1.54 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1120323/e6d844"},

It\u2019s no surprise, then, that wrestling is in his blood; Goldust is the son of Dusty Rhodes, \u201cThe American Dream.\u201d What is it like to be the son of a wrestling icon and follow him into the same profession?

A young man who only wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and threw aside a football scholarship to eke out a meager existence in regional wrestling. A green wrestler struggling to prove to his peers that his work, not his name, had gotten him to where he was. Rhodes describes how, in the midst of a painful five-year estrangement with his father, he finally made a name for himself as Goldust and then let it all go, tumbling into a descent of self-medication that led him away from a red-hot career as a WWE Superstar and nearly cost him his life. When he finally hit bottom, Rhodes knew where to look for help from the family he always had: his father and World Wrestling Entertainment.

Well author Ken Shouler doesn't.  In his  book The Real 100 Best Baseball Players of All-Time...and Why! all of  the above players are considered, but only one can be considered as  the best.  Statistics are the groundwork.  The criteria is  accomplishments not lifestyle and this isn't some tepid alphabetical  list either.    Williams or DiMaggio, Ruth or Aaron, Mays or Mantle, the arguement of  who was better has gone on for generations.  Shouler makes his case  that one player is better than another and why.

Coming from a tumultuous, impoverished household and a dangerous neighborhood on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., in the 1970s, Sugar Ray Leonard rose swiftly and skillfully through the ranks of amateur boxing-and eventually went on to win a gold medal in the 1976 Olympics. With an extremely ill father and no endorsement deals, Leonard decided to go pro. The Big Fight takes readers behind the scenes of a notoriously corrupt sport and chronicles the evolution of a champion, as Leonard prepares for the greatest fights of his life-against Marvin Hagler, Roberto Duran, Tommy Hearns, and Wilfred Benitez. At the same time Leonard fearlessly reveals his own contradictions and compulsions, his infidelity, and alcohol and cocaine abuse.

But Rob Rains and Hellen Carpenter's fascinating, in-depth biography \"James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball\" shows how this young man - who wanted to be a medical doctor, or if not that, a minister (in fact, he was both) - came to create a game that has endured for over a century. \"James Naismith\" reveals how Naismith invented basketball in part to find an indoor activity to occupy students in the winter months. When he realized that the key to his game was that men could not run with the ball, and that throwing and jumping would eliminate the roughness of force, he was on to something. And while Naismith thought that other sports provided better exercise, he was pleased to create a game that 'anyone could play'.  With unprecedented access to the Naismith archives and documents, Rains and Carpenter chronicle how Naismith developed the 13 rules of basketball, coached the game at the University of Kansas - establishing College Basketball in the process - and was honored for his work at the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin.

Cooper", "Maynard Brichford", "Gabriel B Costa"], "rating": "0", "description": "Who was Ray Schalk? \r\"`I think he was a ballplayer. From somewhere around here,'\" said one softball player to a visitor at Ray Schalk Field in Harvel, Illinois, in May 2007, as chronicled by baseball historian Brian E. Cooper in Ray Schalk: A Baseball Biography (August 2009; McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers). \rSchalk, a Harvel native, redefined the role of a catcher through superior defensive skills in a career that spanned the Dead Ball and Lively Ball eras. His journey on the base paths in Major League Baseball began one day before his 20th birthday and ended after 18 seasons with records in games caught, putouts and double plays, while leading the American League eight times in fielding percentage and nine times in putouts. He was the first to catch four no-hit contests and set a record for stolen bases in a season by a catcher (30) in 1916 that was not broken until 1982.  \rIn the first book-length biography of Schalk, Cooper weaves through the stunning career as a player, manager and coach, with historical antidotes and a wealth of photographs to present a complete picture of his life and times. Schalk could have easily carried \"The Natural\" as a nickname; his first big break occurred at the age of 15 in 1908, when he was a last minute replacement at catcher for a semi-pro club in Litchfield, Illinois. He had no errors and tallied several assists, while scoring a pair of runs and notching two hits in three at-bats.  \rA high school standout in basketball, Schalk remained a semi-pro baseball star who could be signed for around $2 a game. He entered the pro game at age 18 on May 9, 1911, with the Class D Taylorville Christians in the Illinois-Missouri League. Schalk was batting .398 and had swiped 13 bases by mid-July, but the league was in financial turmoil and Taylorville - to cut costs - released Schalk for $1,500 to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. \rHis play with the Brewers drew interest from MLB teams and on August 9, 1912, he was dealt to the Chicago White Sox for $10,000 and two players. Schalk was in the starting lineup two days later. \"Until he entered Cooperstown, Schalk classified the afternoon of his first major-league game as his greatest thrill in baseball,\" Cooper writes.   \rSchalk then literally grew up in public. Diminutive in stature for a catcher at 5-foot-9 and 165 pounds, he was often mistaken for a bat-boy in his early years with the ChiSox. He married Lavinia Graham in October 1916, with a daughter - Pauline - born in 1918 and a son - Ray Jr. -  born in 1921. \rAs World War One gripped the nation, Schalk was a key player - batting .286 -  in Chicago's American League pennant and World Series victory in 1917. Bright skies were on the horizon for a possible dynasty in the making, but a tsunami of deceit wiped things out in 1919. \r\"Then there was the Black Sox scandal. Schalk had a unique perspective on the World Series of 1919, when teammates conspired with gamblers and intentionally lost to the Cincinnati Reds,\" Cooper writes. \"Schalk was the first of the honest players - the so-called Clean Sox - to know something was up; after all, he could tell immediately when his pitchers ignored his signals and when they grooved the ball to Reds hitters.\" \rAny lingering anger and frustration stayed inside the heart of the honest star. Cooper cites club owner Charles A. Comiskey trying to prevent the club from being dismantled, while maintaining his iconic reputation in the game, and what happened to Buck Weaver - receiving a lifetime suspension because he did not report the meetings he attended with his Black Sox teammates -  as major reasons why Schalk maintained his own code of silence. \r\"Even after the cover-up failed and Shoeless Joe Jackson and seven others received lifetime suspensions, Schalk maintained his silence,\" Cooper writes. \"That to his dying day (Schalk) refused to tell what he knew about the scandal not only frustrated fans and researchers, it diluted his prominence in baseball history.\" \rBy 1924, lingering injuries made Schalk a battered veteran at age 32. A 1927 photograph of his gnarled right hand truly tells the story of a player who dons the armor of a catcher. A player-manager for Chicago in 1927 and 1928, he was a coach and player (five games) in 1929 for the New York Giants. Schalk only appeared in 23 games from 1927-1929 and retired with 1,727 regular season defensive appearances out of 1,762 games played. \rHe stayed in the game as a coach for the Chicago Cubs and manager for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League, Indianapolis Indians of the American Association and - going full-circle on the diamond - for the Brewers for the last half of the 1940 season before calling it a career at the age of 48.  In 1955, Schalk gained enshrinement in the National Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum through a vote by the Veteran's Committee. His .253 career batting average is the lowest for an inductee who was a position player. \rSchalk's health was declining precipitously by 1969 and the family suffered a tragic loss when Ray Jr. committed suicide in February 1970. On May 19 of that year, Schalk, 77, died of complications caused by cancer of the esophagus.  \r\"He was usually the shortest man on the field, but Schalk was the yardstick against whom other catchers were measured,\" Cooper writes.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2009", "publisher": "McFarland", "language": "english", "pages": "339", "ISBN10": "0786441488", "ISBN13": "9780786441488", "file": "PDF, 13.56 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/681857", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/681857/a9e7e5"},

Michael Oher is the young man at the center of the true story depicted in The Blind Side movie (and book) that swept up awards and accolades. Though the odds were heavily stacked against him, Michael had a burning desire deep within his soul to break out of the Memphis inner-city ghetto and into a world of opportunity. While many people are now familiar with Oher's amazing journey, this is the first time he shares his account of his story in his own words, revealing his thoughts and feelings with details that only he knows, and offering his point of view on how anyone can achieve a better life.  Looking back on how he went from being a homeless child in Memphis to playing in the NFL, Michael talks about the goals he had for himself in order to break out of the cycle of poverty, addiction, and hopelessness that trapped his family for so long. He recounts poignant stories growing up in the projects and running from child services and foster care over and over again in search of some familiarity. Eventually he grasped onto football as his ticket out of the madness and worked hard to make his dream into a reality. But Oher also knew he would not be successful alone. With his adoptive family, the Touhys, and other influential people in mind, he describes the absolute necessity of seeking out positive role models and good friends who share the same values to achieve one's dreams.  Sharing untold stories of heartache, determination, courage, and love, I Beat the Odds is an incredibly rousing tale of one young man's quest to achieve the American dream.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2011", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "Gotham", "language": "english", "pages": "250", "ISBN10": "1592406122", "ISBN13": "9781592406128", "file": "EPUB, 270 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1055330/f90087"},

His high-flying acrobatics have thrilled fans on every continent. He's been crowned champion of the world's greatest wrestling promotions, from Mexico to the U.S. But he's never revealed the inside story of who he is.   Until now.   Wrestling fans know him as Rey Mysterio, an American luchador of unparalleled talent, the ultimate proof that good things come in small packages. Now for the first time, Rey adds the personal side to the story:    \u2022 How he had to fight to get a tryout in the ring \u2022 Who he was before Rey Misterio Jr. -- and even before Colibri, usually noted as his first identity \u2022 What it was like to wrestle in Mexico -- from the bullrings to the riots \u2022 How he fought plans for his unmasking in WCW -- and why he wishes he hadn't succeeded \u2022 The inside story of the 619, the West Coast Pop, and his other signature moves \u2022 The impact of Eddie Guerrero on his career in WWE \u2022 The personal struggle that cost him ring time in 2008 but ultimately made him a stronger man \u2022 His real passion in life as husband and father    In Rey Mysterio: Behind the Mask, Rey talks candidly about his twenty-plus-year career, from the days of sneaking into bars as a fourteen-year-old to his most recent showdowns in WWE. He speaks of the emotional moments in the ring with his uncle Rey Misterio, and the dark days when he went under the knife to repair his damaged knee. Along the way, Mysterio introduces American audiences to the mysteries of lucha libre, the high-flying, anything-goes Mexican wrestling style that he has done so much to popularize in the U.S. He also talks about the debts he owes to wrestlers such as Konnan, known as the Mexican Hulk Hogan, and dishes some behind-the-scenes dirt on the collapse of WCW at the height of the Monday Night Wars. Mysterio talks tenderly -- but realistically -- of his friend Eddie Guerrero, providing a well-rounded picture of one of the most beloved wrestling figures of recent history. He also details his march toward the Heavyweight Championship, and his mastery of the WWE Triple Crown -- a feat that placed him in an elite group for all time.

Their uncommonly competitive relationship came to symbolize the most compelling rivalry in the NBA. These were the basketball epics of the 1980s--Celtics vs Lakers, East vs West, physical vs finesse, Old School vs Showtime, even white vs black. Each pushed the other to greatness--together Bird and Johnson collected 8 NBA Championships, and 6 MVP awards and helped save the floundering NBA at its most critical time. When it started they were bitter rivals, but along the way they became lifelong friends.  With intimate, fly-on-the-wall detail, When the Game Was Ours transports readers to this electric era of basketball and reveals for the first time the inner workings of two players dead set on besting one another. From the heady days of trading championships to the darker days of injury and illness, we come to understand Larry's obsessive devotion to winning and how his demons drove him on the court. We hear him talk with candor about playing through chronic pain and its truly exacting toll. In Magic we see a young, invincible star struggle with the sting of defeat, not just as a player but as a team leader. We are there the moment he learns he's contracted HIV and hear in his own words how that devastating news impacted his relationships in basketball and beyond. But always, in both cases, we see them prevail. A compelling, up-close-and-personal portrait of basketball's most inimitable duo, When the Game Was Ours is a reevaluation of three decades in counterpoint.

They\u2019re won on draft day in the spring\u2014 in the war room.  In this landmark book, New York Times bestselling author Michael Holley takes readers behind the scenes of three contending National Football League teams and into the brilliant minds of Bill Belichick and his two former prot?g?s\u00a0Thomas Dimitroff and Scott Pioli.   Holley masterfully shows how a single idea conceived by Belichick in 1991\u2014how to build the perfect team\u2014triggered a journey filled with miraculous finishes, heartbreaking losses, broken relationships, and Super Bowl championships. Readers are given unprecedented access\u2014from the draft room to the locker room to the sidelines\u2014and insights into why Belichick is considered to be the NFL\u2019s best coach and premier strategist.  Before he achieved success, though, Belichick was barely surviving as a coach. War Room opens in Cleveland, where Belichick, a young head coach,\u00a0worked in\u00a0an office with\u00a0two employees in their late twenties: Pioli, a low-paid scouting assistant, and\u00a0Dimitroff, a groundskeeper and part-time scout. After Belichick was fired by the Browns in 1996, the three men were in separate cities and seemingly a lifetime away from being recognized as leaders and\u00a0champions. But soon they were reunited in New England, where they refined and burnished Belichick\u2019s method for constructing a winning team, overseeing one of the greatest franchises in modern NFL history.   These three master strategists are now competitors. Belichick continues at the helm of the New England Patriots, while Pioli is now in charge of the Kansas City Chiefs and Dimitroff is running the Atlanta Falcons. And even though they no longer work for the same franchise, they do have a common\u00a0goal: building the perfect team, one draft pick and one trade at a time.   War Room is their unique and often astonishing story. It is packed with never-been-told anecdotes and new observations from team officials, players, coaches, and scouts, all leading to surprising and groundbreaking insights into the art of building a champion.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2011", "publisher": "HarperCollins", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0062082396", "ISBN13": "9780062082411", "file": "EPUB, 2.11 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1201028/9320da"},

Upfield"], "rating": "0", "description": "The Genius is the gripping and definitive account of Bill Walsh\u2019s career and how he built a football dynasty from the rubble of a fallen franchise. David Harris gives a stellar account of the silver-haired sophisticate from humble working-class roots who was hired as head coach and general manager of the San Francisco Forty Niners in January 1979 and became the architect of what is arguably the greatest ten-year run in NFL history. With unmatched access to players, fellow coaches, executives, the reporters who covered the Niners\u2019 heyday, and Walsh himself, Harris recounts how Walsh, through tactical and organizational genius, created a football juggernaut. There were also the demons that pushed and haunted Walsh throughout his career: his clash with his former mentor, Paul Brown, who denied Walsh his first pro head-coaching job with the Cincinnati Bengals; Walsh\u2019s struggle with self-doubt and criticism; the toll his single-minded devotion to football exacted on his family; and his complex relationship with the Forty Niners\u2019 owner, Edward DeBartolo, Jr.Walsh\u2019s pre-Niners coaching odyssey was arduous\u2013a longtime assistant coach, he developed his legendary and now-standard pass-oriented West Coast offense during stops at all levels of the game. Despite never having run a team\u2019s draft before, Walsh, along with his right-hand man John McVay, quickly built the foundation for a dynasty by drafting or trading for a durable core of stars, including Joe Montana, Fred Dean, Hacksaw Reynolds, Dwight Clark, and Ronnie Lott. (Walsh would later restock the team with such players as Jerry Rice, Steve Young, and Charles Haley.) The key to Walsh\u2019s genius perhaps lay in his keen understanding of his athletes\u2019 psyches\u2013he knew what brought out the best in each of them. But the scope of Walsh\u2019s impact on the game extended well beyond the field and locker room. The Forty Niners\u2019 life-skills counseling program, which Walsh spearheaded with the sports sociologist and activist Dr. Harry Edwards, and the internship program Walsh devised to bring minority coaches into the game have since been adopted by the NFL for all league franchises.In the annals of sport, few individuals have had as great an impact on their game\u2013or on its relevance to life outside the lines\u2013as Bill Walsh. With knowledge, skill, passion, and a critical eye, David Harris reveals the brilliant man behind the coaching legend.The vision Bill Walsh brought to all his pioneering efforts was a function of his perception of himself as someone who was far more than a football coach. He cherished his standing and participation in the larger world outside the NFL and nurtured them at every opportunity.\u201cKnowing Bill Walsh was kind of like the blind man describing an elephant,\u201d one of the sportswriters who covered him observed. \u201cWe all knew just one little piece of him. But he had all these other areas we knew nothing about. He dealt with lots of people outside of football, outside of our scope entirely. He was able to deal with politicians, people who were intellects in other areas. They were impressed by him.\u201d\u2013from The Genius", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - Sports & Adventure Biography", "year": "2008", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Random House", "language": "english", "pages": "399", "ISBN10": "1400066654", "ISBN13": "9781400066650", "file": "PDF, 2.85 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1044451", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1044451/3bfdb9"},

Tris Speaker: The Rough-and-Tumble Life of a Baseball Legend is the first book to tell the full story of Speaker\u2019s turbulent life and to document in sharp detail the grit and glory of his pivotal role in baseball\u2019s dead-ball era.\u00a0Playing for the Boston Red Sox and the Cleveland Indians in the early part of the twentieth century, Tris \u201cSpoke\u201d Speaker put up numbers that amaze us even today: his record for career doubles\u2014792\u2014may never be approached, let alone broken. Tris Speaker explores the colorful life behind the statistics, introducing readers to a complex and contradictory Texan whose cowboy mentality never left him as he brawled his way through two decades in the big leagues.\u00a0Speaker\u2019s career put him in the company of Ty Cobb and Christy Mathewson, Shoeless Joe Jackson and Honus Wagner, and in describing it Timothy M. Gay gives a rousing account of some of the best baseball ever played\u2014and some of the darkest moments that ever tainted a game and hastened the end of a career. His four years of research on Speaker unearthed a document that suggests that cheating induced by gambling was far more widespread in early baseball than officials have acknowledged. Gay\u2019s book captures the bygone spirit of the big leagues\u2019 rough-and-tumble early years and restores one of baseball\u2019s true greats\u2014and a truly larger-than-life personality\u2014to his rightful place in the American sports pantheon.

George directly influenced the likes of Muhammad Ali, who took his bragging and boasting from George; James Brown, who began to wear sequined capes onstage after seeing George on TV; John Waters, whose films featured the outrageous drag queen Divine as an homage to George; and too many wrestlers to count. Amid these pop culture discoveries are firsthand accounts of the pro wrestling game from the 1930s to the 1960s.The ideal American male used to be stoic, quiet, and dignified. But for a young couple struggling to make ends meet, in the desperation born of the lingering Depression and wartime rationing, an idea was hatched that changed the face of American popular culture, an idea so bold, so over-the-top and absurd, that it was perfect. That idea transformed journeyman wrestler George Wagner from a dark-haired, clean-cut good guy to a peroxide-blond braggart who blatantly cheated every chance he got. Crowds were stunned\u2014they had never seen anything like this before\u2014and they came from miles around to witness it for themselves.Suddenly George\u2014guided by Betty, his pistol of a wife\u2014was a draw. With his golden tresses grown long and styled in a marcel, George went from handsome to . . . well . . . gorgeous overnight, the small, dank wrestling venues giving way to major arenas. As if the hair wasn't enough, his robes\u2014unmanly things of silk, lace, and chiffon in pale pinks, sunny yellows, and rich mauves\u2014were but a prelude to the act: the regal entrance, the tailcoat-clad valet spraying the mat with perfume, the haughty looks and sneers for the \"peasants\" who paid to watch this outrageously prissy hulk prance around the ring. How they loved to see his glorious mane mussed up by his manly opponents. And how they loved that alluringly alliterative name . . . Gorgeous George  . . . the self-proclaimed Toast of the Coast, the Sensation of the Nation!All this was timed to the arrival of that new invention everyone was talking about\u2014television. In its early days, professional wrestling and its larger-than-life characters dominated prime-time broadcasts\u2014none more so than Gorgeous George, who sold as many sets as Uncle Miltie.Fans came in droves\u2014to boo him, to stick him with hatpins, to ogle his gowns, and to rejoice in his comeuppance. He was the man they loved to hate, and his provocative, gender-bending act took him to the top of the entertainment world.

In Practice to Deceive, her first book-length investigative chronicle since In the Still of the Night, Rule unravels a shattering case of Christmastime murder off the coast of Washington State\u2014presented with the clarity, authority, and emotional depth that Rule\u2019s readers expect. It\u2019s a case with enough drama, greed, sex, and scandal to be called \u201cThe Real Housewives of Whidbey Island,\u201d but this was not reality television. This was murder: pure, cruel, ugly, and senseless. And someone had to pay the price.  Nestled in Puget Sound, Whidbey Island is a gem of the Pacific Northwest; accessible only by ferry and the soaring Deception Pass Bridge, it is known for its artistic communities and stunning natural beauty. Life there is low-key, insular, and the island\u2019s year-round residents tend to know one another\u2019s business. But when the blooddrenched body of Russel Douglas was discovered the day after Christmas in his SUV in a hidden driveway near Whidbey\u2019s most exclusive mansions, the whole island was shocked. A single bullet between his eyes was the cause of death, but no one could imagine who among them could plot such a devious, cold-blooded crime. At first, police suspected suicide, tragically common at the height of the holiday season. But when they found no gun in or near the SUV, Russel\u2019s manner of death became homicide. Like a cast of characters from a classic mystery novel, a host of Whidbey residents fell under suspicion.  Brenna Douglas was Russel\u2019s estranged and soon-to-be-ex wife, who allowed him to come home for a Christmas visit with their children. The couple owned the popular Just B\u2019s salon. Brenna\u2019s good friend Peggy Sue Thomas worked there, and Brenna complained often to her that Russel was physically and emotionally abusive. Peggy Sue\u2019s own life has been one of extremes. Married three times, hers is a rags-to-riches-and-back-again tale in which she\u2019s played many roles: aircraft mechanic, basketball coach, the \u201cdrop-dead gorgeous\u201d beauty queen as a former Ms. Washington, Las Vegas limousine driver, million-dollar horse breeder, wealthy divorc\u00e9e. But in 2003, her love affair with married guitarist Jim Huden led the two Whidbey Island natives to pursue their ultimate dreams of wealth and privilege\u2014even at the expense of human life.

Among the motives addressed are lust, control, glory, profit, thrill, delusions, rage, the desire for company, the need to please a partner, and even murder as an intellectual exercise. Serial killers live double lives, hiding their violence even from those who live with them, so along with a study of motives are chapters devoted to how close associates have described killers, including parents, siblings, co-workers, lovers, and survivors.

The mecca \r\nfor wealthy retirees to enjoy their younger girlfriends, yachts and \r\nmarble-floored mansions, where recreational drugs, sex and booze flow \r\nlike the warm water that hugs the coast. Where teenage girls and their \r\nboyfriends kill their parents in the name of love, and women shoot their\r\n boyfriends then claim self-defense. New York Times bestselling crime \r\nauthors Caitlin Rother and Gregg Olsen join to release this compilation \r\nof murder cases from the vacation destination that is home to Disney \r\nWorld and miles of beaches, yet also has more killers on its death row \r\nthan any other state but California. This compilation pairs two sets of \r\ncases with similar circumstances but very different outcomes. In the \r\nfirst story, a former flight attendant murders her multimillionaire \r\nboyfriend of eighteen years, using a gun, a knife, a hammer (and \r\npossibly poisoned his gin as well), claiming he was abusive for years \r\nand put a loaded gun to her head. In the second story, a woman with a \r\nhistory of violent, drug-addicted boyfriends kills her latest lover \r\nafter only a few weeks together, alleging that he forced a gun into her \r\nmouth in a drug-induced rage. In the third story, a 15-year-old girl \r\nfalls in love and wants to have a baby with a boyfriend who is four \r\nyears older. Her mother, who wants to end the relationship, ends up dead\r\n after being stabbed, choked, and injected with a syringe loaded with \r\nbleach. Finally, a 16-year-old girl and her 20-year-old boyfriend \r\nconspire to fatally bludgeon her disapproving father with a baseball \r\nbat.  Welcome to Georgia, where the all-mighty dollar trumps \r\nmercy and lawfulness on an all-too-regular basis. Where hit men can be \r\nhired for small sums and lovers can be manipulated into killing innocent\r\n people, all out of greed. In the first story, the socialite wife of a \r\nmultimillionaire is fatally shot by a flower delivery man on the day of a\r\n key divorce hearing. After sending authorities on a global fugitive \r\nhunt, the man responsible is brought back to face justice twenty years \r\nlater, wearing only one sandal on his gout-ridden feet. In the second, a\r\n crooked businessman trying to go straight is shot in his driveway by a \r\nhit man wearing a ski mask and camouflage gear\u2014one in a nationwide \r\nseries of contract-for-hire murders, advertised in the classified-ad \r\npages of Soldier of Fortune magazine. And finally, a Gulf War veteran \r\nand father of three is kidnapped, beaten and stabbed by the lover of his\r\n on-and-off-again wife, who wants to collect life insurance benefits and\r\n pay off her house. The lover makes a deal for a life sentence and a \r\nchance at parole, while the wife gets the death penalty. She becomes the\r\n second woman ever to be executed in Georgia, even after the Pope, other\r\n faith-based advocates and two of her children fight for her clemency, \r\nciting her dramatic repentance and rehabilitation through religion.  And\r\n finally, in South Carolina, where racial strife and righteous, \r\nheavily-armed indignation leads to murder. Rother brings listeners a \r\ncompilation of crime stories from this former Confederate state: the \r\nfirst woman in South Carolina to go to the electric chair after a \r\nvengeful feud over a dead calf turned fatal; the state's most prolific \r\nserial killer who managed to kill a fellow prisoner while on death row; \r\nand the young white man accused of trying to incite a race war by \r\nfatally shooting nine African-Americans during Bible study in a historic\r\n church.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - True Crime", "year": "2016", "publisher": "Notorious USA", "language": "english", "pages": "226", "ISBN10": "1534606238", "ISBN13": "9781534606234", "file": "EPUB, 486 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5304379/798e53"},

But in secret, Washington is confused and divided about what to do. Who are these mysterious figures tearing Mexico apart? they wonder. What is El Narco?El Narco draws the first definitive portrait of Mexico's drug cartels and how they have radically transformed in the last decade. El Narco is not a gang; it is a movement and an industry drawing in hundreds of thousands from bullet-ridden barrios to marijuana-growing mountains. And it has created paramilitary death squads with tens of thousands of men-at-arms from Guatemala to the Texas border. Journalist Ioan Grillo has spent a decade in Mexico reporting on the drug wars from the front lines. This piercing book joins testimonies from inside the cartels with firsthand dispatches and unsparing analysis.

They were old family friends, confidants, companions...But then things changed. Witnessing Ronnie and Reggie become increasingly psychotic - taking murder, torture and rape to sickening new levels - Bobby knew he had to take action. Unknown to his brothers, he became a police informer; risking not just his own life but those of the people dearest to him too. Using the codename 'Phillips', he was forced to live on his wits, feeding back information to Scotland Yard.

Bobby fled the country, but now 40 years on he's back. And he wants to set the record straight.

Mining there, as everywhere, was not an easy life, but regardless \r\nof the risk, there was something about being underground, the lure of \r\nhitting a deep vein of silver. The promise of good money and the intense\r\n bonds of friendship brought men back year after year. Mining is about \r\nbeing a man and a fighter in a job where tomorrow always brings the hope\r\n of a big score. On May 2, 1972, 174 miners entered Sunshine \r\nMine on their daily quest for silver. Aboveground, safety engineer Bob \r\nLaunhardt sat in his office, filing his usual mountain of federal and \r\nstate paperwork. From his office window he could see the air shafts that\r\n fed fresh air into the mine, more than a mile below the surface. The \r\nair shafts usually emitted only tiny coughs of exhaust; unlike \r\ndangerously combustible coal mines, Sunshine was a fireproof hardrock \r\nmine, nothing but cold, dripping wet stone. There were many safety \r\nconcerns at Sunshine, but fire wasn\u2019t one of them. The men and the \r\ncompany swore the mine was unburnable, so when thick black smoke began \r\npouring from one of the air shafts, Launhardt was as amazed as he was \r\nalarmed. When the alarm sounded, less than half of the dayshift \r\nwas able to return to the surface. The others were trapped underground, \r\ntoo deep in the mine to escape. Scores of miners died almost \r\nimmediately, frozen in place as they drilled, ate lunch, napped, or \r\nchatted. No one knew what was burning or where the smoke had come from. \r\nBut in one of the deepest corners of the mine, Ron Flory and Tom \r\nWilkinson were left alone and in total darkness, surviving off a trickle\r\n of fresh air from a borehole. The miners\u2019 families waited and \r\nprayed, while Launhardt, reeling from the shock of losing so many men on\r\n his watch, refused to close up the mine or give up the search until he \r\ncould be sure that no one was left underground.In The Deep Dark,\r\n Gregg Olsen looks beyond the intensely suspenseful story of the fire \r\nand rescue to the wounded heart of Kellogg, a quintessential company \r\ntown that has never recovered from its loss. A vivid and haunting \r\nchapter in the history of working-class America, this is one of the \r\ngreat rescue stories of the twentieth century.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - True Crime", "year": "2013", "publisher": "St. Martin's True Crime", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0307237303", "ISBN13": "9780307237309", "file": "EPUB, 370 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3316639/843336"},

What is far more likely is that the perverse urge to repeatedly and intentionally kill has existed throughout human history, and that a substantial percentage of serial murders throughout ancient times, the middle ages, and the pre-modern era were attributed to imaginative surrogate explanations: dragons, demons, vampires, werewolves, and witches.Legends, Monsters, or Serial Murderers? The Real Story Behind an Ancient Crime dispels the interrelated misconceptions that serial murder is an American crime and a relatively recent phenomenon, making the novel argument that serial murder is a historic reality\u2014an unrecognized fact in ancient times. Noted serial murderers such as the Roman Locuta (The Poisoner); Gilles De Rais of France, a prolific serial killer of children; Andres Bichel of Bavaria; and Chinese aristocratic serial killer T'zu-Hsi are spotlighted.

Eighteen hours later, Matthew was found tied to a log fence on the outskirts of town, unconscious and barely alive. He had been pistol-whipped so severely that the mountain biker who discovered his battered frame mistook him for a Halloween scarecrow. Overnight, a politically expedient myth took the place of important facts. By the time Matthew died a few days later, his name was synonymous with anti-gay hate. Stephen Jimenez went to Laramie to research the story of Matthew Shepard\u2019s murder in 2000, after the two men convicted of killing him had gone to prison, and after the national media had moved on. His aim was to write a screenplay on what he, and the rest of the nation, believed to be an open-and-shut case of bigoted violence. As a gay man, he felt an added moral imperative to tell Matthew\u2019s story. But what Jimenez eventually found in Wyoming was a tangled web of secrets. His exhaustive investigation also plunged him deep into the deadly underworld of drug trafficking. Over the course of a thirteen-year investigation, Jimenez traveled to twenty states and Washington DC, and interviewed more than a hundred sources. Who was the real Matthew Shepard and what were the true circumstances of his brutal murder? And now that he was larger than life, did anyone care? The Book of Matt is sure to stir passions and inspire dialogue as it re-frames this misconstrued crime and its cast of characters, proving irrefutably that Matthew Shepard was not killed for being gay but for reasons far more complicated \u2014 and daunting.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - True Crime", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Steerforth", "language": "english", "pages": "368", "ISBN10": "1586422146", "ISBN13": "9781586422141", "file": "EPUB, 7.19 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2191328/31d279"},

After 28 years working as a prison officer, with 22 years at HMP Parkhurst, once one of Britain's most high security prisons, David Berridge has had to deal with it all: serial killers and gangsters, terrorists and sex offenders, psychopaths and addicts. Inside Parkhurst is his raw, uncompromising look at what really goes on behind the massive walls and menacing gates. Thrown in at the deep end, David quickly had to work out how to deal with the most cunning and volatile of prisoners, and learn how to avoid their many scams. He has been assaulted and abused; he has tackled cell fires and attempted suicides, riots and dirty protests; he has helped to foil escaped plans, talked inmates down from rooftop protests, witnessed prisoners setting fire to themselves, and prevented prisoners from attempting to murder other prisoners. And now he takes us inside this secret world for the first time. With this searingly honest account he guides us around the wings, the segregation unit, the hospital and the exercise yard, and gives vivid portraits of the drug taking, the hooch making, the constant and irrepressible violence, and the extraordinary lengths our prison officers go to everyday. Divided into three parts - the first from David's early years on the wings, the second the middle of his career, and the third his disillusioned later years - David will take readers into the heart of life inside and shine a light on the escalating violence and the impact the government cuts are having on the wings.

When was the last time you read something that you just had to share with somebody and soon had you reading passages aloud? When was the last time you read something that was so startling that it made you think, \"My God, not only am I not in Kansas anymore, I'm not even sure what planet I'm on!\"  Well, welcome to the world of \"Disco Bloodbath,\" and the crazy, maddening, terrifying, bizarre, and totally charming people who inhabit it, doing all sorts of unspeakable things to each other -- and to themselves -- all in an effort to keep ennui at bay just for one more day.  \"Disco Bloodbath\" is a dazzling, dizzying, amazingly vivid, and startlingly fresh look at a subculture that for several years pranced its hedonistic way across the dance floors of New York City's trendiest clubs. It is also perhaps the funniest book about a murder you will ever read. Like its author, who experienced it all and has lived to tell the tale, it's a true original.  When self-proclaimed king of club kids and party promoter extraordinaire Michael Alig was convicted in November 1996 of killing a drug dealer known as Angel, a spotlight was trained on a world few people even knew existed. Author James St. James knew that world, of course; in fact, he was one of its creators. He also knew the rules, knew them inside out, because he helped write them. And while it was a life and a lifestyle in which just about anything was acceptable so long as it wasn't boring, murder was considered a no-no. So when Alig confessed his part in the crime to St. James, our author knew that there could be no going back -- andthat this time the party really was over.  Now, in this unflinching tell-all book, James St. James leads the reader into the bizarre, almost surreal universe of abandon and gender-bending amorality, decadence, and drugs that he knew so well. And in a writing style as addictive as any drug, he details the rise and fall of Michael Alig, a kid from South Bend, Indiana, who burst on the downtown scene in the 1980s and quickly rose to the top as the mastermind of parties so outrageous that they became the stuff of legend.  Like its author and the people it depicts, this expose is outrageous and fascinating, much like seeing an accident on the side of the road that you feel compelled to stare at. Hysterically funny, heartbreakingly tragic, and wickedly decadent, \"Disco Bloodbath\" is both St. James's attempt at closure and a stunning literary achievement", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - True Crime", "year": "1999", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "language": "english", "pages": "286", "ISBN10": "0684857642", "ISBN13": "9780684857640", "file": "EPUB, 3.11 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1308959/da5850"},

Though no large financial institution has recently gone bust in this country, white-collar criminals, scam artists, Ponzi schemers and organized crime, from the Hells Angels to the Russian mafia, know that Canada is the place in the Western world to rip off investors.

They will meet the bogus investment gurus, the brokers who lose money with both reckless abandon and impunity, the bankers who squander money in toxic investments, the lawyers who protect them and the regulators who do nothing to keep them from doing it again.

The issue of HRV has become a sensitive subject in many South Asian and Middle Eastern countries and it has received the growing attention of the media, human rights groups and academics around the globe. However, the issue has yet to receive detailed academic study in the United Kingdom, particularly in terms of both legal and sociological research. This collection sets out the theoretical and ethical parameters of the study of HRV in order to address this intellectual vacuum in a socio-legal context. The key objectives of this book are: to construct, and to develop further, a theory of HRV; to rationalise and characterise the different forms of HRV; to investigate the role of religion, race and class in society within this context, in particular, the role of Islam; to scrutinise the role of the civil/criminal law/justice systems in preventing these crimes; and to inform public policy-makers of the potential policies that may be employed in combating HRV.", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - True Crime", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Routledge-Cavendish", "language": "english", "pages": "251", "ISBN10": "0203846982", "ISBN13": "9780203846988", "file": "PDF, 1.94 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1209006", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1209006/88da35"},

Retired Police Sergeant Drew Peterson, thirty years Stacy's senior, steadfastly asserted his innocence and maintained that his wife had simply fled their tumultuous marriage and run off with another man. Throngs of journalists and camera crews besieged Peterson's quiet suburban cul-de-sac, but the ex-cop seemed to relish this newfound limelight. As exhaustive searches for Stacy's body turned up nothing and suggestive clues led nowhere, questions were raised: about their unusual marriage, about Stacy's past vocal concerns for her safety, and about Drew Peterson's bizarre public behavior in the wake of Stacy's disappearance. Then, in February 2008, came a startling development. After a second autopsy, the unusual death of Peterson's third wife, Kathleen Savio, was ruled a homicide. Three and a half years earlier, Savio had been found dead in the bathtub of their home, but in light of Stacy's curious disappearance, Kathleen's body was exhumed and the case was reopened. Two of Drew Peterson's four wives, it appeared, had met untimely fates tragic and unexpected but hardly coincidental.Drawing upon exclusive interviews with Stacy's friends and family and even Drew himself, Chicago-area reporter Joseph Hosey presents the most researched account of the Stacy Peterson case yet. Still, as the charges against Drew Peterson mount, one haunting question remains: Where on earth is Stacy?", "categories": "Biography & Autobiography - True Crime", "year": "2008", "edition": "1st ed", "publisher": "Phoenix Books", "language": "english", "pages": "320", "ISBN10": "1597776068", "ISBN13": "9781614671206", "file": "MOBI , 940 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1255635/91b381"},
