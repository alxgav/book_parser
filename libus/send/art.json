Originally published in 1992 by Hartley & Marks Publishers, it was revised in 1996, 2001 (v2.4), 2002 (v2.5), 2004 (v3.0), 2005 (v3.1), 2008 (v3.2), and 2012 (v4.0). A history and guide to typography, it has been praised by Hermann Zapf, who said \u201cI wish to see this book become the Typographers\u2019 Bible.\u201d Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones consider it \u201cthe finest book ever written about typography\u201d, according to the FAQ section of their type foundry\u2019s website. Because of its widespread use, it is sometimes abbreviated simply as Bringhurst.\n\r\nWhat accounts for the lasting influence and popularity of Bringhurst\u2019s book? There are three reasons: the range and depth of his treatment, the quality of his writing, and the confidence and generosity of his tone.\n\r\nBringhurst\u2019s scope is wide: the fundamentals and finer points of macro- and micro typography, type anatomy and classification; choosing typefaces and page formats; the use of diacritics and other analphabetic symbols (no doubt his experience as a translator of languages that rely on extensive diacritical support in the Latin alphabet has sensitized him to these matters); annotated lists of designers and foundries; glossaries of glyphs and terminology; and more. Besides distilling centuries of typographic expertise, his treatment of it is remarkably thorough: he doesn\u2019t pretend that his book is an exhaustive account of typography, but his care and attention to detail is obvious (in places even overwhelming). And all of it is supported by well-made illustrations and diagrams. It would be hard to find another writer in English who commands as much knowledge about the use of writing and print to capture language as Bringhurst does, and that he can condense it into 386 pages (in this edition) that many people will read (once more) from half-title to colophon is impressive.\n\r\nThe quality of Bringhurst\u2019s writing allows him to pull this off. Knowledge, experience, judgment, and enthusiasm are not always accompanied by writing skill, and like many academic and quasi-academic fields, typography is not flush with talented prose stylists. But the fact that Bringhurst came to book design and typography from poetry is evident on every page. He is a gifted author used to making every word tell, and his prose is (to borrow Robin Kinross\u2019s description from Modern Typography) \u201cserene\u201d and \u201cincantatory\u201d. He finds words that capture \u2014 more completely than practically any of us can muster \u2014 why typography matters. This is most simply and succinctly evident in \u201cfirst principles\u201d: \u201cTypography exists to honor content.\u201d", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2004", "edition": "3", "publisher": "Hartley & Marks", "language": "english", "pages": "386", "ISBN10": "0881792055", "ISBN13": "9780881792058", "file": "PDF, 59.67 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2568513", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2568513/4248dd"},

For a decade or so, iconic architecture has been fuelled by the market economy and consumers' insatiable appetite for the novel and the different. The relentless speed and scale of urbanisation, with its ruptured, decentralised and fast-changing context, though, demands a rethink of the role of the designer and the function of architecture. This title of 2 confronts and questions the profession's and academia's current inability to confidently and comprehensively describe, conceptualise, theorise and ultimately project new ideas for architecture in relation to the city. In so doing, it provides a potent alternative for projective cities: Typological Urbanism. This pursues and develops the strategies of typological reasoning in order to re-engage architecture with the city in both a critical and speculative manner. Architecture and urbanism are no longer seen as separate domains, or subservient to each other, but as synthesising disciplines and processes that allow an integrating and controlling effect on both the city and its built environment.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2011", "edition": "1", "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons", "language": "english", "pages": "140", "ISBN10": "047074720X", "ISBN13": "9780470747209", "file": "PDF, 71.07 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1268030", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1268030/39620c"},

Cabins & Cottages: and Other Small Spaces will inspire you to think smaller and smarter.\n\r\nThink small! With each turn of the page you'll be captivated by gorgeous photographs of inspiring, exciting small spaces. In this collection from Fine Homebuilding magazine, the featured authors focus on homes both new and remodeled, urban and rural, traditional and modern, and even a few truly quirky spaces like:\n\r\n\u2022 A Garden Cottage for Low-Impact Living\r\n\u2022 Watch Island Retreat\r\n\u2022 Do-it-Yourself Retreat\r\n\u2022 A Cottage Fit for a Hobbit\r\n\u2022 A New Floor Plan Saves an Old House\r\n\u2022 Carriage-House Comeback\r\n\u2022 A Better House Not a Bigger One\r\n\u2022 plus other small structures like Stylish Sheds, Studio, Storage and More.\n\r\nSmaller=Smarter. Smaller homes can serve all the purposes of a much larger home, you simply need careful planning and smart strategies. Since smaller homes are becoming more popular-due to economic factors, smaller family sizes, tighter building lots, and the desire to use fewer natural resources-builders and designers are getting creative and employing all their best tricks to help homeowners get the most out of their tight spaces.\n\r\nSmall in structure. Big in style. The petite, stylish homes featured throughout Cabins & Cottages are as big as they need to be and perfectly fit the lifestyles and aspirations of their homeowners.

Urban design and planning in a changing urban context so that it remains relevant for people is elusive because the idea of place is embedded in memory and identity\u2014but whose memory and whose identity? This book seeks to understand the urban change dynamic so that the planning of urban places aligns with the dynamic of people\u2019s perception of place.  Planning Urban Places examines the premise that building cities is a concrete business surrounded by a shifting context. It discusses the notion of urban design and placemaking from the perspective of place perception and cognitive psychology, place philosophy and human geography. It also considers network theory to help illustrate the self-organising paradigm of small word network theory for planning urban places. Mary Ganis has worked as an architect and urban designer in private practice, government and academia. This diverse experience has enabled her \r\nto integrate urban design practice and theory as well as explore urban design \r\nand planning questions from different perspectives.

Susannah Hagan uses this as a basis to argue for developments in the future and argues that these theories are not 'just an intellectual and aesthetic regression' as they are often perceived to be.

This period has also seen the creation of countless new purpose-built museums and galleries, suggesting a fundamental re-evaluation of the processes of designing and shaping of museums.  Museum Making: Narratives, Architectures, Exhibitions examines this re-making by exploring the inherently spatial character of narrative in the museum and its potential to connect on the deepest levels with human perception and imagination. Through this uniting theme, the chapters explore the power of narratives as structured experiences unfolding in space and time as well as the use of theatre, film and other technologies of storytelling by contemporary museum makers to generate meaningful and, it is argued here, highly effective and affective museum spaces. Contributions by an internationally diverse group of museum and heritage professionals, exhibition designers, architects and artists with academics from a range of disciplines including museum studies, theatre studies, architecture, design and history cut across traditional boundaries including the historical and the contemporary and together explore the various roles and functions of narrative as a mechanism for the creation of engaging and meaningful interpretive environments.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2012", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Routledge", "language": "english", "pages": "357", "ISBN10": "0415676029", "ISBN13": "9780415676021", "file": "PDF, 12.04 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1316958", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1316958/e788a4"},

Standardized twenty-                 and forty-foot shipping containers carry material goods across oceans and over land;                 provide shelter, office space, and storage capacity; inspire films, novels,                 metaphors, and paradigms. Today, TEU (Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit, the official                 measurement for shipping containers) has become something like a global currency. A                 container ship, sailing under the flag of one country but owned by a corporation                 headquartered in another, carrying auto parts from Japan, frozen fish from Vietnam,                 and rubber ducks from China, offers a vivid representation of the increasing,                 world-is-flat globalization of the international economy. In The Container                 Principle, Alexander Klose investigates the principle of the container and                 its effect on the way we live and think.Klose explores a series                 of \"container situations\" in their historical, political, and cultural                 contexts. He examines the container as a time capsule, sometimes breaking loose and                 washing up onshore to display an inventory of artifacts of our culture. He explains                 the \"Matryoshka principle,\" explores the history of land-water transport,                 and charts the three phases of container history. He examines the rise of logistics,                 the containerization of computing in the form of modularization and standardization,                 the architecture of container-like housing (citing both Le Corbusier and Malvina                 Reynolds's \"Little Boxes\"), and a range of artistic projects inspired by                 containers. Containerization, spreading from physical storage to organizational                 metaphors, Klose argues, signals a change in the fundamental order of thinking and                 things.

This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.

Smart Cities are employing information and communication technologies in the quest for sustainable economic development and the fostering of new forms of collective life. This has made the Smart City an essential focus for engineers, architects, urban designers, urban planners, and politicians, as well as businesses such as CISCO, IBM and Siemens. Despite its broad appeal, few comprehensive books have been devoted to the subject so far, and even fewer have tried to relate it to cultural issues and to assume a truly critical stance by trying to decipher its consequences on urban space and experience. This cultural and critical lens is all the more important as the Smart City is as much an ideal permeated by Utopian beliefs as a concrete process of urban transformation. This ideal possesses a strong self-fulfilling character: our cities will become \u2018Smart\u2019 because we want them to. This book opens with an examination of the technological reality on which Smart Cities are built, from the chips and sensors that enable us to monitor what happens within the infrastructure to the smartphones that connect individuals. Through these technologies, the urban space appears as activated, almost sentient. This activation generates two contrasting visions: on the one hand, a neo-cybernetic ambition to steer the city in the most efficient way; and on the other, a more bottom-up, participative approach in which empowered individuals invent new modes of cooperation. A thorough analysis of these two trends reveals them to be complementary. The Smart City of the near future will result from their mutual adjustment. In this process, urban space plays a decisive role. Smart Cities are contemporary with a \u2018spatial turn\u2019 of the digital. Based on key technological developments like geo-localisation and augmented reality, the rising importance of space explains the strategic role of mapping in the evolution of the urban experience. Throughout this exploration of some of the key dimensions of the Smart City, this book constantly moves from the technological to the spatial as well as from a critical assessment of existing experiments to speculations on the rise of a new form of collective intelligence. In the future, cities will become smarter in a much more literal way than what is often currently assumed.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2015", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Wiley", "language": "english", "pages": "168", "ISBN10": "1119075599", "ISBN13": "9781119075622", "file": "PDF, 84.98 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2655031", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2655031/908e75"},

Sometimes these projects generate unprecedented solutions; sometimes they converge on common goals and realize larger transformations. As Ezio Manzini describes in this book, we are witnessing a wave of social innovations as these changes unfold -- an expansive open co-design process in which new solutions are suggested and new meanings are created. Manzini distinguishes between diffuse design (performed by everybody) and expert design (performed by those who have been trained as designers) and describes how they interact. He maps what design experts can do to trigger and support meaningful social changes, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration. These range from community-supported agriculture in China to digital platforms for medical care in Canada; from interactive storytelling in India to collaborative housing in Milan. These cases illustrate how expert designers can support these collaborations -- making their existence more probable, their practice easier, their diffusion and their convergence in larger projects more effective. Manzini draws the first comprehensive picture of design for social innovation: the most dynamic field of action for both expert and nonexpert designers in the coming decades.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2015", "publisher": "The MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "241 / 257", "file": "PDF, 1.78 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2856145", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2856145/8fc5c4"},

In exhibiting a large portion of these works, the Metropolitan once again invites the visitor\u2014and the reader of this accompanying catalogue\u2014to examine the product of a single fertile, inventive, and tireless mind through the rich veins of material housed at the Museum. The exhibition also gives us the chance to reassess the body of work in terms of recent scholarship. Additionally, since much of Toulouse-Lautrec's work is on paper and can be exhibited for only intermittent and limited periods of time, this show has given us an opportunity to examine these works from the point of view of conservation. Indeed, as it turned out, a number of the works on paper underwent extensive treatment before going on view.The Museum's collection of art by Toulouse-Lautrec, the result largely of generous donations from private collectors, includes paintings, drawings, and examples of his finest and most important prints. The artist excelled in lithography; a hundred years ago his bold, persistent experimenting gave this medium an entirely new appearance just when the centennial of its invention was being marked in Europe. In fact, with the wealth of examples at the Metropolitan Museum, we now can celebrate the bicentennial of lithography through the works of Toulouse-Lautrec, the artist who virtually reinvented this medium.(This title was originally published in 1995/96.)", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "1996", "publisher": "Metropolitan Museum of Art", "language": "english", "pages": "72 / 74", "ISBN10": "0870998048", "ISBN13": "9780870998041", "file": "PDF, 13.44 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2289278", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2289278/946d87"},

Rem Koolhaas's celebration and analysis of New York depicts the city as a metaphor for the incredible variety of human behavior. At the end of the nineteenth century, population, information, and technology explosions made Manhattan a laboratory for the invention and testing of a metropolitan lifestyle -- \"the culture of congestion\" -- and its architecture.  \"Manhattan,\" he writes, \"is the 20th century's Rosetta Stone . . . occupied by architectural mutations (Central Park, the Skyscraper), utopian fragments (Rockefeller Center, the U.N. Building), and irrational phenomena (Radio City Music Hall).\" Koolhaas interprets and reinterprets the dynamic relationship between architecture and culture in a number of telling episodes of New York's history, including the imposition of the Manhattan grid, the creation of Coney Island, and the development of the skyscraper. Delirious New York is also packed with intriguing and fun facts and illustrated with witty watercolors and quirky archival drawings, photographs, postcards, and maps. The spirit of this visionary investigation of Manhattan equals the energy of the city itself.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "1994", "publisher": "Monacelli Press", "language": "english", "pages": "321", "ISBN10": "1885254008", "ISBN13": "9781885254009", "file": "PDF, 43.93 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1197814", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1197814/b2e8ca"},

This acclaimed autobiography presents a fascinating portrait of one of the great spiritual figures of our time. With engaging candor, eloquence, and wit, Paramahansa Yogananda tells the inspiring chronicle of his life: the experiences of his remarkable childhood, encounter with many saints and sages during his youthful search throughout India for an illumined teacher, ten years of training in the hermitage of a revered yoga master, and the thirty years that he lived and taught in America. Also recorded here are his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Burbank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other celebrated spiritual personalities of East and West. The author clearly explains the subtle but definite laws behind both the ordinary events of everyday life and the extraordinary events commonly termed miracles. His absorbing life story becomes the background for a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence. Selected as ''One of the 100 Best Spiritual Books of the Twentieth Century,''  Autobiography of a Yogi  has been translated into 20 languages, and is regarded worldwide as a classic of religious literature. Several million copies have been sold, and it continues to appear on best-seller lists after more than sixty consecutive years in print. Profoundly inspiring, it is at the same time vastly entertaining, warmly humorous and filled with extraordinary personages.

His paintings, which combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, had a formative influence on Baroque painting.Caravaggio trained as a painter in Milan under Simone Peterzano who had himself trained under Titian. In his twenties Caravaggio moved to Rome where there was a demand for paintings to fill the many huge new churches and palazzos being built at the time. It was also a period when the Church was searching for a stylistic alternative to Mannerism in religious art that was tasked to counter the threat of Protestantism. Caravaggio's innovation was a radical naturalism that combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of chiaroscuro which came to be known as tenebrism (the shift from light to dark with little intermediate value).He gained attention in the art scene of Rome in 1600 with the success of his first public commissions, the Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and Calling of Saint Matthew.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "language": "english", "file": "EPUB, 73.56 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3047825/a36e46"},

From then on, architecture was influenced by seminal texts by Aldo Rossi and Robert Venturi, and gave rise to the first revisionary movement following Modernism. Bringing together leading experts in the field, this book provides a comprehensive, critical overview of the developments in architecture from 1960 to 2010. It consists of two parts: the first section providing a presentation of major movements in architecture after 1960, and the second, a geographic survey that covers a wide range of territories around the world. This book not only reflects the different perspectives of its various authors, but also charts a middle course between the 'aesthetic' histories that examine architecture solely in terms of its formal aspects, and the more 'ideological' histories that subject it to a critique that often skirts the discussion of its formal aspects.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2014", "edition": "New edition", "publisher": "Ashgate Publishing Limited", "language": "english", "pages": "350", "ISBN10": "140943981X", "ISBN13": "9781409439813", "file": "PDF, 19.27 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2615371", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2615371/f50b14"},

The dome would literally need to be erected over thin air.Of the many plans submitted, one stood out\u2014a daring and unorthodox solution to vaulting what is still the largest dome (143 feet in diameter) in the world. It was offered not by a master mason or carpenter, but by a goldsmith and clock maker named Filippo Brunelleschi, then 41, who would dedicate the next 28 years to solving the puzzles of the dome\u2019s construction. In the process, he did nothing less than reinvent the field of architecture.Brunelleschi\u2019s Dome is the story of how a Renaissance genius bent men, materials, and the very forces of nature to build an architectural wonder we continue to marvel at today. Denounced at first as a madman, Brunelleschi was celebrated at the end as a genius. He engineered the perfect placement of brick and stone, built ingenious hoists and cranes (some among the most renowned machines of the Renaissance) to carry an estimated 70 million pounds hundreds of feet into the air, and designed the workers\u2019 platforms and routines so carefully that only one man died during the decades of construction\u2014all the while defying those who said the dome would surely collapse and personal obstacles that at times threatened to overwhelm him. This drama was played out amidst plagues, wars, political feuds, and the intellectual ferments of Renaissance Florence\u2014events Ross King weaves into the story to great effect, from Brunelleschi\u2019s bitter, ongoing rivalry with the sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti to the near capture of Florence by the Duke of Milan. King also offers a wealth of fascinating detail that opens windows onto fifteenth-century life: the celebrated traditions of the brickmaker\u2019s art, the daily routine of the artisans laboring hundreds of feet above the ground as the dome grew ever higher, the problems of transportation, the power of the guilds.Even today, in an age of soaring skyscrapers, the cathedral dome of Santa Maria del Fiore retains a rare power to astonish. In telling the story of the greatest engineering puzzle of the Renaissance and one of the world\u2019s architectural marvels, Ross King brings its creation to life in a fifteenth-century chronicle with twenty-first-century resonance.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2000", "publisher": "Walker & Co.", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0142000159", "ISBN13": "9780142000151", "file": "EPUB, 1.16 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1221210/a78e9b"},

The nation\u0092s architectural achievements range from its earliest walled cities and the First Emperor\u0092s vision of city and empire, to bridges, pagodas, and the twentieth-century constructions of the Socialist state. In this beautifully illustrated book, Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt presents the first fully comprehensive survey of Chinese architecture in any language. With rich political and historical context, Steinhardt covers forty centuries of architecture, from the genesis of Chinese building through to the twenty-first century and the challenges of urban expansion and globalism.Steinhardt follows the extraordinary breadth of China\u0092s architectural legacy\u0097including excavation sites, gardens, guild halls, and relief sculpture\u0097and considers the influence of Chinese architecture on Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Tibet. Architectural examples from Chinese ethnic populations and various religions are examined, such as monasteries, mosques, observatories, and tombs. Steinhardt also shows that Chinese architecture is united by a standardized system of construction, applicable whether buildings are temples, imperial palaces, or shrines. Every architectural type is based on the models that came before it, and principles established centuries earlier dictate building practices. China\u0092s unique system has allowed its built environment to stand as a profound symbol of Chinese culture.With unprecedented breadth united by a continuous chronological narrative, Chinese Architecture offers the best scholarship available on this remarkable subject for scholars, students, and general readers.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2019", "publisher": "Princeton Univers.

It presents a compendium of concepts and ideas that have emerged from landscape architecture, planning, and environmental policy and landscape management.Using a range of illustrated case studies, it provokes discussions on the major themes driving the growth of cities by exploring the underlying tensions around notions of sustainable settlement, climate change adaption, urban migration, new modes of governance and the role of landscape in policy and decision making at national, provincial and municipal levels.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2020", "publisher": "Routledge", "language": "english", "pages": "227", "ISBN10": "1138600873", "ISBN13": "9781138600874", "file": "PDF, 16.18 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5339697", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5339697/16f12a"},

Her highly anticipated new book provides a series of workshops demonstrating how to push the boundaries of watercolour, using key techniques to develop your own work and take your paintings to the next level.\n\r\nAnn's easy-to-follow, step-by-step projects demonstrate how some of her most dramatic paintings are created. She describes in detail some of the key techniques used and how you can experiment with alternative methods to create your own interpretations. Finally, her beautiful and inspirational artworks demonstrate how different interpretations of a subject might take an unexpected or unusual direction, and how to make the most of these opportunities.\n\r\nThe book moves, with progressively challenging projects, from loose wildflower meadows, textured woodland and rustic rambling walls to atmospheric or semi-abstract landscape corners, all rendered in Ann\u2019s adventurous signature style. Loose, expressive mark-making and unusual techniques include combining water-based paint and ink with granulation medium for dramatic texture, drawing with twigs, using gesso and collage to create unique effects; manipulating paint with materials such as plastic wrap (clingfilm); developing printed marks made using found materials.\n\r\nFollowing the huge demand for more practical guidance in experimental painting, the book provides plenty of techniques and instruction. Ann\u2019s personal commentary also gives a unique insight into the mind of the artist \u2013 ways of looking at your subject, how to explore and experiment \u2013 to unlock the potential of your watercolour painting.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2018", "publisher": "Batsford", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9781849945073", "file": "EPUB, 22.02 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3686151/aff722"},

Richer has found a network of significant geographic alignments, associated with the pathways of various legendary figures and gods, that are geomantic keys to many legends and texts. One of these texts is Plato\u2019s Laws in which Plato describes the layout of the ideal city. Richer found Plato\u2019s ideal city repeated around the most important oracular centers on ancient Greece. He shows how Plato\u2019s description was a later codification of a much earlier practice of dividing geography into twelve regions under the patronage of the gods of the zodiac.

With \"Chroma,\" the Greek word for color, as its title, this illustrated book provides answers to these questions and makes it clear that color is much more than mere decoration it is one of the central problems of creative work. In the process, \"Chroma\" embraces the sensuous experience of color, inspiring and seducing the reader with unusual projects, from industrial products to color field painting. The book presents works by younger designers like Stefan Diez and Arik Levy as well as famous artists like Ellsworth Kelly.  All of the works are presented in large-scale reproductions and also in a kind of color gradient, in which they are assigned to the chapters \"monochromatic,\" \"multichromatic,\" and \"achromatic.\" The spectrum encompasses all conceivable shades and combinations, from brilliant and colorful through tasteful and subdued all the way to black-and-white contrasts. An additional chapter analyzes the work of outstanding artists, architects, and designers like Gerhard Richter, Konstantin Grcic, and Sauerbruch Hutton, who grapple with color to an unusual degree and have formulated characteristic chromatic worlds.

This is going to be the century of the city. But what actually makes a good city? Why are some cities a joy to live in? As Charles Montgomery reveals, it's not how much money your neighbours earn, or how pleasant the climate is that makes the most difference. Journeying to dozens of cities - from Atlanta to Bogota to Vancouver - he talks to the new champions of the happy city to explore the urban innovations already transforming people's lives. He meets the visionary Colombian mayor who turned some of the world's most dangerous roads into an urban cycling haven; the Danish architect who brought the lessons of medieval Tuscan towns to modern-day Copenhagen; and the New York City transport commissioner who turned the gridlock of Times Square into a place to lounge in the sun. Drawing on the lessons from their stories, from brain science, and from the fascinating realm of urban experimentation, Happy City offers solutions we can all use to improve our lives and shows that simple changes can make all the difference. \"Do we live in neighbourhoods that make us happy? Montgomery encourages us to ask without embarrassment, and to think intelligently about the answer\". (The New York Times Book Review). \"Excellent...Montgomery believes in the importance of smart town planning and Happy City is a compendium of its major ideas\". (Will Dean, Independent). Charles Montgomery is a journalist and urban experimentalist from Vancouver, Canada. His writings on urban planning, psychology, culture, and history have appeared in magazines and journals on three continents.

In the 1960s, the architects of Britain's Archigram group and  Archigram  magazine turned away from conventional architecture to propose cities that move and houses worn like suits of clothes. In drawings inspired by pop art and psychedelia, architecture floated away, tethered by wires, gantries, tubes, and trucks. In  Archigram: Architecture without Architecture , Simon Sadler argues that Archigram's sense of fun takes its place beside the other cultural agitants of the 1960s, originating attitudes and techniques that became standard for architects rethinking social space and building technology. The Archigram style was assembled from the Apollo missions, constructivism, biology, manufacturing, electronics, and popular culture, inspiring an architectural movement\u2014High Tech\u2014and influencing the postmodern and deconstructivist trends of the late twentieth century.    Although most Archigram projects were at the limits of possibility and remained unbuilt, the six architects at the center of the movement, Warren Chalk, Peter Cook, Dennis Crompton, David Greene, Ron Herron, and Michael Webb, became a focal point for the architectural avant-garde, because they redefined the purpose of architecture. Countering the habitual building practice of setting walls and spaces in place, Archigram architects wanted to provide the equipment for amplified living, and they welcomed any cultural rearrangements that would ensue.  Archigram: Architecture without Architecture \u2014the first full-length critical and historical account of the Archigram phenomenon\u2014traces Archigram from its rediscovery of early modernist verve through its courting of students, to its ascent to international notoriety for advocating the ''disappearance of architecture.''", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2005", "publisher": "The MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "253", "ISBN13": "9780262693226", "file": "PDF, 10.48 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/807411", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/807411/205421"},

But the accuracy of seismic capacity estimates\u2014which can prevent catastrophic loss of life and astronomical damage repair costs\u2014depends on the use of the correct basic input parameters.   Seismic Design Aids for Nonlinear Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Structures  simplifies the estimation of those vital parameters. Many design engineers make the relatively common mistake of using default properties of materials as input to nonlinear analyses without realizing that any minor variation in the nonlinear characteristics of constitutive materials, such as concrete and steel, could result in a solution error that leads to incorrect assessment or interpretation.   Streamlined Analysis Using a Mathematical Model  To achieve a more accurate pushover analysis and improve general performance-based design, this book reassesses some key inputs, including axial force-bending moment yield interaction, moment-curvature, and moment-rotation characteristics. It analyzes these boundaries using a detailed mathematical model of reinforced concrete sections based on international codes, and then proposes design curves and tables derived from the authors\u2019 studies using a variety of nonlinear tools, computer programs, and software. The text reviews relevant literature and describes mathematical modeling, detailing numerical procedures step by step.  Including supplementary online material that can be used to compute any parameter, this reference delineates nonlinear properties of materials so that they can be used instantly for seismic analysis without having to solve cumbersome equations.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2010", "edition": "1", "publisher": "CRC Press", "language": "english", "pages": "268", "ISBN10": "1439809143", "ISBN13": "9781439809143", "file": "PDF, 7.32 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/682194", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/682194/bde2f2"},

The notion of tectonics as employed by Frampton--the focus on architecture as a constructional craft--constitutes a direct challenge to current mainstream thinking on the artistic limits of postmodernism, and suggests a convincing alternative. Indeed, Frampton argues, modern architecture is invariably as much about structure and construction as it is about space and abstract form.Composed of ten essays and an epilogue that trace the history of contemporary form as an evolving poetic of structure and construction, the book's analytical framework rests on Frampton's close readings of key French and German, and English sources from the eighteenth century to the present. He clarifies the various turns that structural engineering and tectonic imagination have taken in the work of such architects as Perret, Wright, Kahn, Scarpa, and Mies, and shows how both constructional form and material character were integral to an evolving architectural expression of their work. Frampton also demonstrates that the way in which these elements are articulated from one work to the next provides a basis upon which to evaluate the works as a whole. This is especially evident in his consideration of the work of Perret, Mies, and Kahn and the continuities in their thought and attitudes that linked them to the past.Frampton considers the conscious cultivation of the tectonic tradition in architecture as an essential element in the future development of architectural form, casting a critical new light on the entire issue of modernity and on the place of much work that has passed as \"avant-garde.\"A copublication of the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies and The MIT Press.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2001", "publisher": "MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "448 / 447", "ISBN10": "0262561492", "ISBN13": "9780262561495", "file": "PDF, 28.66 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5207302", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5207302/bda6d9"},

Vollmann"], "rating": "0", "description": "What Is This Book About?\r\nFrom the keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen, to voice-enabled assistants and virtual reality, we have never had more ways to interact with technology. Called modes, they allow people to enter input and receive output from their devices. These inputs and outputs are often designed together in sets to create cohesive user interfaces (UIs). These modes reflect the way our senses, cognitive functions, and motor skills also work together in sets called modalities. Human modalities have existed for far longer than our interface modes, and they enable us to interact with the physical world. Our devices are only beginning to catch up to us. We can now jump and move around in our living rooms to play a game using Microsoft\u2019s motion-tracking peripheral, Kinect. We can ask Domino\u2019s to deliver a pizza using the Amazon Echo.\n\r\nWe often use several modalities together in our daily activities, and when our devices can do the same, they are considered multimodal UIs. Most UIs are already multimodal, but because they\u2019re so familiar we don\u2019t tend to think of them that way. In fact, almost all designed products and environments are multimodal. We see a door and knock on it, waiting for it to open or to hear someone inside ask who it is. We use our fingers to type on a keyboard, and see characters appear on the screen in front of our eyes. We ask Siri a question and see the oscilloscope-like waveform to let us know we are being heard. We receive a phone call and feel the vibration, hear the ringtone, and see the name of the person on the screen in front of us. We play a video game and are immersed in sensory information from the screen, speakers, and the rumble shock controller in our hands.\n\r\nMultimodal products blend different interface modes together cohesively. They allow us to experience technology the same way we experience our everyday lives: across our senses. Good multimodal design helps us stay focused on what we are doing. Bad multimodal design distracts us with clumsy or disjointed interactions and irrelevant information. It pulls us out of our personal experience in ways that are at best irritating and at worst dangerous.\n\r\nAs technology is incorporated into more contexts and activities in our lives, new types of interfaces are rapidly emerging. Product designers and their teams are challenged to blend modalities in new combinations for new products in emerging categories. They are being asked to add new modalities to the growing number of devices we use every day. This book provides these teams with an approach to designing multimodal interactions. It describes the human factors of multimodal experiences, starting with the senses and how we use them to interact with both physical and digital information. The book then explores the opportunities represented by different kinds of multimodal products and the methodologies for developing and designing them. Following this approach will develop multimodal experiences for your users. You will be able to deliver successful products that earn trust, fulfill needs, and inspire delight.\n\r\nWho Should Read This Book\r\nThis book is for designers who are developing or transforming products with new interface modes, and those who want to. It will extend knowledge, skills, and process past screen-based appraoches, and into the next wave of devices and technologies. The book also helps teams that are integrating products across broader physical environments and behaviors. The senses and cognition are the foundation of all human experience, and understanding them will help blend physical and digital contexts and activities successfully. Ultimately, it is for anyone who wants to create better products and services. Our senses are the gateway to the richness, variety, delight, and meaning in our lives. Knowing how they work is key to delivering great experiences.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2018", "publisher": "O\u2019Reilly Media", "language": "english", "pages": "296", "ISBN13": "9781491954249", "file": "EPUB, 25.92 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3499541/509986"},

These monuments have been the subject of many books over the centuries, but our aim, through the skill and stature of the writers, is to get something much more enlightening, stimulating, even controversial, than straightforward histories or guides.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2004", "publisher": "Profile Books", "language": "english", "pages": "220", "ISBN10": "1861973012", "ISBN13": "9781861973016", "file": "PDF, 3.66 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1109269", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1109269/d4fb8c"},

They assess recent experimental trends and explore the functions of orality, ethnicity, and power in ethnographic composition. Writing Culture argues that ethnography is in the midst of a political and epistemological crisis: Western writers no longer portray non-Western peoples with unchallenged authority; the process of cultural representation is now inescapably contingent, historical, and contestable.

His images present complex geometrical structures, rich stucco decorations, and elaborate paintings as they have never been seen before. Brilliantly calibrated exposures reveal details and colors that would otherwise remain hidden in these dimly lit spaces.

Beauty is found in the intricate details of our lives. This is something that most children learn to appreciate even though they may not recognize it, or understand how to express it in terms that we understand. This could be one reason why coloring is such a treasured pastime for children. It allows them the opportunity to express the beauty in the small details that they notice every day.  Fortunately, there has been a recent increase of interest in coloring for adults as well, and I believe that the appreciation for the beauty that we sometimes neglect is one reason that this is so. Along with this, adult coloring brings an opportunity for self expression and relaxation without any long term commitment. It can be done alone or with friends, with the simplest of tools or the most elaborate. As adults, we gain something even richer and more satisfying from coloring, especially when the images are intricately beautiful and inspiring.

Photoshop is usually used for enhancing photos, but this extremely powerful software package is capable of so much more. Every feature, from brushes to background, can be customised and optimised for artistic effect. With a little guidance from a pro, your photoshop results can go from competent retouching of images to visually stunning re-interpretations of them, turning everyday pictures into breathtaking works of art.  In this beautiful and inspiring book, acclaimed artist, author and lecturer Susan Bloom shows you how to do just that. Starting with the fundamentals: creating your own artistic brushes and textured papers virtually, she goes on to demonstrate how to create a variety of classic artistic styles in Photoshop, with chapters on watercolours, pastels, charcoal and oil. Further chapters cover illustration techniques in photoshop, and using third-party software to create painterly effects.  While the results are highly polished and realistic, this is not a book written specifically for artists. The techniques are aimed squarely at the Photoshop user looking to broaden their pallette, with emphasis on altering photographs to create artwork, rather than creating artwork from scratch.   Beautifully written, clearly laid out, and guaranteeing inspiring results, this book is a must-have for every Photoshop user.                                         * Guide to using Photoshop to create fine art from photographs, covering many different artistic styles * Highly visual, inspiring content with clear step-by-step instructions and hundreds of screenshots * Backwards compatible approach: author has taken care to ensure that this fully up-to-date title also applies to previous editions of Photoshop", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2009", "publisher": "Focal Press", "language": "english", "pages": "245", "ISBN10": "0240811143", "ISBN13": "9780080928319", "file": "PDF, 33.70 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/647469", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/647469/e12198"},

New for this edition is the inclusion of colour to help students recognize the different sections of the book and to enhance the garment illustrations? Colour illustrations also offer a new dimension to the updated material on computer-aided design and the CAD chapter now provides students with a clear guide to the technology.The size charts have been revised to reflect the changes in body sizing, the co-ordination with European size charts and to the way that clothes are now marketed to different sectors. The great expansion of casual wear has led to the growth of 'flat cutting' with no darting, and the section devoted to this type of cutting has been further expanded.This best-selling textbook with its tried-and-tested presentation of authoritative text and clear diagrams remains the essential purchase for students of fashion and design.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2008", "edition": "5", "publisher": "Blackwell Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "218", "ISBN10": "1405175672", "ISBN13": "9781405175678", "file": "PDF, 11.30 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1005849", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1005849/3edfc6"},

This comprehensive, well-illustrated book was created to solve the problem.In these pages George Bridgman \u2014 a longtime instructor at New York's Art Student League and one of the nation's foremost teachers of figure drawing \u2014 offers expert advice on depicting draped figures. \"Clothing is none other than a drapery arranged around a body that is beneath it. To express the multitudinous forms it takes, one should learn to express in a direct way the different characters of folds, for each one plays its individual part as distinctly apart as actors play their different characters upon the stage.\"Students learn the characteristics of seven different kinds of folds and how to render them, including pipe, zigzag, spiral, half-lock, diaper pattern, drop, and inert folds. Mastery of these principles is the key to realistic portrayal of garments, as well as the proper rendering of cloth in still lifes. The straightforward, easy-to-follow text is illustrated by 200 of Bridgman's own sketches and diagrams, reproduced from pencil renderings in crisp halftones.

What tools can the Lead Designer use to address the many complexities of developing a design as part of an iterative process? How can the Lead Designer redefine what they do using a digital world to provide profoundly different and new services? This book analyses at all of these questions, setting out how the Lead Designer can perform effectively and efficiently in the digital world, addressing clients' new whole life project requirements and new ways of constructing and assembling buildings.Managing increasing numbers of specialists in the construction process requires experience to ensure that their contributions are properly managed and produced at the right time. This book considers this challenge. It will also consider how the Lead Designer can effectively lead and manage health and safety aspects and risks (the principal designer role in UK regulations).This book replaces the current publication, Leading the Team: An Architect's Guide to Design Management, published in 2011.

Damluji"], "rating": "0", "description": "Perhaps it is because I come from the same background (Western Anglo-Catholic) as the approach from which Richard Kieckhefer comes in this text that I find such a resonance with what he has to say.  'Theology in Stone' looks at various aspects of church design, from the long tradition of church building in Christianity up to the present time.  His text begins with four principle factors in basic church design, and then looks in some detail at three particular styles.   \rThe four factors highlighted are not typical architectural concerns, but rather wrapped up in spiritual, theological, and aesthetic values.  How does the space work?  What is the central and centering focus?  Is there an aesthetic impact compatible with the intention of the church?  How do symbols function and resonate?  There are no universal answers to these types of questions.  As Kieckhefer states, 'Response to a church [is] conditioned by culture and by cultural interaction.'    Response is also related to expectations, usefulness, the people populating the church, and a number of other concerns.  However, perhaps most importantly, response to a church is a learned process that generally 'requires informed reflection.  The meanings of a church are seldom obvious.'   \rWith regard to spatial dynamics and centering focus, Kieckhefer states, the purpose of the building is expressed.  The symbolic resonance goes to the meaning of the church, and the aesthetic impact relates to the form.  Kieckhefer takes classic church architecture ideas and applies them not to the task of planning and building a church as much as to understanding how the buildings function and have meaning for those who use them now.  Kieckhefer also differentiates between the issue of what a church has meant and what a church can mean.   \rThe churches Kieckhefer highlights include Beverly Minster, a church in the then second city of York (York, of course, being the second city, ecclesiastically speaking, of England, after Canterbury).  The examination of this church, along with others, takes into account the surrounding community, the geography of the church's placement, and the population that peoples the church.  'The meaning of church architecture can never be read in abstraction from local ethos,' Kieckhefer states.  This is also true of Chicago, where there is about as diverse a collection of churches as anywhere else on the planet.  Still, there are discernable patterns here, according to Kieckhefer.  'There were three basic approaches to liturgical space in these churches:  the design of Roman Catholic churches was appropriate mainly for intercession, that of Protestant churches for proclamation, and that of Eastern Orthodox churches for meditation.'  Kieckhefer examines here the churches of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, 'a time just before the rise of architectural modernism and liturgical reform.'  Kieckhefer's third area of discussion focuses upon the work of Rudolf Schwarz, whose strong, simple designs rely on reinterpretations of classic architectural ideas and embraces liturgical principles both ancient and modern.   \rKieckhefer concludes the book with a dicussion of modern issues, doing significant theological reflection, including the tension between modern and traditional designs (both from intention and actual application), movements toward increased congregational participation, and other pulls between orthodoxy and dogmatism (which Kieckhefer describes as being opposites for his purposes here).  He sees great resilience in the past, which can give new life and freedom to modern designs. \rKieckhefer writes well, and his arguments are interesting to follow.  They tend toward the sacramental side, but has a healthy respect for different views in his presentation.  His endnotes are helpful and worthwhile, but a bibliography (even as a simple list) would be helpful.  There is a good index, and a number of black-and-white photographs (most done by Kieckhefer himself).   \rThis is a text that will be of interest beyond the architectural crowd, but to any who seek to understand the way in which church architecture has meaning and can mean for the community.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2004", "edition": "illustrated edition", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "390", "ISBN10": "0195154665", "ISBN13": "9780195154665", "file": "PDF, 3.78 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/738746", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/738746/538bb9"},

Drawing from their extensive experience, the authors explain how better plans (and consequently better places) can be created by applying the three-dimensional principles of urban design and physical place-making to planning problems.  Design First uses case studies from the authors' own professional projects to demonstrate how theory can be turned into effective practice, using concepts of traditional urban form to resolve contemporary planning and design issues in American communities.

This book enhances this skill so that given an unfamiliar building, you will have the tools to understand it and to be inspired by it. Author Paulette Singley encourages you to misread, closely read, conventionally read, and unconventionally read architecture to stimulate your creative process.This book explores three essential ways to help you understand architecture: reading a building from the outside-in, from the inside-out, and from the position of out-and-out, or formal, architecture. This book erodes boundaries between the frequently compartmentalized fields of interior design, landscape design, and building design with chapters exploring concepts ofterroir, scenography, criticality, atmosphere, tectonics, inhabitation, type, form, and enclosure. Using examples and case studies that span a wide range of historical and global precedents, Singley addresses the complex interaction among the ways a building engages its context, addresses its performative exigencies, and operates as an autonomous aesthetic object.\u3000Including over 300 images, this book is an essential read for both undergraduate and postgraduate students of architecture with a global focus on the interpretation of buildings in their context.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2019", "publisher": "Routledge", "language": "english", "pages": "411", "ISBN10": "0415836204", "ISBN13": "9780415836203", "file": "PDF, 43.88 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5258980", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5258980/dd8809"},

Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture\" is a definitive and richly illustrated volume that presents the oeuvre of one of this century's most influential practitioners, teachers, and thinkers in architecture. Here is the detailed account of the architecture and philosophy of Louis Kahn, whose buildings have become the very signature of the modernist aesthetic and whose vision permanently changed the direction of American architecture.Kahn's career is documented here with meticulous attention to all aspects of his work-- from his own fascinating biography to the unique philosophy that underlies his buildings to the structures themselves. The stunning range of Kahn's architectural vision becomes fully apparent: his structures are at once solemn and resonant, elemental and musical. Extraordinary, exclusively commissioned color photographs of his masterworks-- the Yale Center for British Art, the National Assembly complex at Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum, the Indian Institute of Management, the Salk Institute-- exquisitely demonstrate how Kahn's architecture wholly reinvents space and light. In all, more than two hundred illustrations, including numerous drawings and floor plans, accompany the painstakingly researched text.This volume-- published in association with the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and with the exclusive participation of the Louis I. Kahn Collection-- contains six principal essays that critically address different dimensions and periods of Kahn's architecture. The essays and photography are accompanied by succinct notes and captions, as well as a complete list of buildings and projects and an index, makingthis book the preeminent scholarly and illustrative source for Kahn's architecture.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "1997", "publisher": "Universe Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "272 / 139", "ISBN10": "0789300990", "ISBN13": "9780789300997", "file": "PDF, 26.99 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5269328", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5269328/013c5a"},

The development of interpretive modes of various stripes--post-structuralist, Marxian, phenomenological, psychoanalytic, as well as others dissenting or eccentric--has given scholars a range of tools for rethinking architecture in relation to other fields and for reasserting architectures general importance in intellectual discourse.    This anthology presents forty-seven of the primary texts of architecture theory, introducing each with an explication of the concepts and categories necessary for its understanding and evaluation. It also presents twelve documents of projects or events that had major theoretical repercussions for the period. Several of the essays appear here in English for the first time.

He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice). During his lifetime he was often called da Cadore, taken from the place of his birth.Recognized by his contemporaries as \"The Sun Amidst Small Stars\" (recalling the famous final line of Dante's Paradiso), Titian was one of the most versatile of Italian painters, equally adept with portraits, landscape backgrounds, and mythological and religious subjects. His painting methods, particularly in the application and use of color, would exercise a profound influence not only on painters of the Italian Renaissance, but on future generations of Western art.During the course of his long life, Titian's artistic manner changed drastically[5] but he retained a lifelong interest in color. Although his mature works may not contain the vivid, luminous tints of his early pieces, their loose brushwork and subtlety of tone are without precedent in the history of Western painting.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "language": "english", "file": "EPUB, 59.96 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3048432/2a3f66"},

A researched study on two of art's most fundamental themes, Color and Light bridges the gap between abstract theory and practical knowledge. Beginning with a survey of underappreciated masters who perfected the use of color and light, the book examines how light reveals form, the properties of color and pigments, and the wide variety of atmospheric effects. Gurney cuts though the confusing and contradictory dogma about color, testing it in the light of science and observation. A glossary, pigment index, and bibliography complete what will ultimately become an indispensible tool for any artist.This book is the second in a series based on his blog, gurneyjourney.com. His first in the series, Imaginative Realism, was widely acclaimed in the fantastical art world, and was ranked the #1 Bestseller on the Amazon list for art instruction.\"James Gurney's new book, Color and Light, cleverly bridges the gap between artistic observation and scientific explanation.

The three-part treatment begins with a brief but informative history of tree painting through the ages, highlighted with images by Titian, Rubens, Constable, Turner, and other masters. Advancing to a well-illustrated series of guiding principles, the author discusses the cultivation of an artistic appreciation for trees and offers preliminary drawing exercises. The third, and most extensive, section explores color choices and techniques. Progressing from simple to complex methods, Hill proposes the best materials for use in formats from monoprints and drypoint to mezzotint and etching. Additional topics include composition, style, patterns, and texture. Seven paintings in full color appear among the author's 150 helpful illustrations. A pioneer in the development of art therapy, Hill draws upon his vast experience in teaching students at every level to offer an accessible approach that will benefit all readers.

The book is organized in six parts. Part I starts with an introduction of key developments in the historic evolution of structures and proceeds to introduce loads on buildings and basic systems to resist them. Part II introduces fundamentals: statics and strength of material, as well as analysis and design of basic elements, such as beams and columns. Part III introduces design methods: ASD and LRFD; design of masonry (ASD) and concrete (strength method); design for wind and seismic forces; as well as conceptual design, explored on case studies. Part IV introduces structure systems for horizontal spans, categorized by bending, axial, form, and tensile resistance. All systems are introduced with conceptual diagrams, describing their structural behavior and alternate options. Case studies describe their use in real projects. Part V introduces vertical structures in similar fashion. Part VI introduces material properties and details for wood, steel, masonry, concrete, and membrane structures. Appendices include math derivation, graphs and tables. Text srd graphics \u0437\u0433\u0435 correlated on the same page for easy reeding end comprehension. Prerequisites for the book are algebra, trigonometry, and Newtonian physics. The book can be used in courses of s'ai:cs -and strength of material, structure systems and structural materials.

He stresses the importance of intelligent design in dealing with such problems as overheating and overcooling, excessive energy use, leaky roofs and windows, fire safety, and noisy interiors. He serves up some surprises: thermal insulation is generally a better investment than solar collectors; board fences are not effective noise barriers; there's one type of window that can be left open during a rainstorm. The new edition emphasizes \"green\" architecture and eco-conscious design and construction. It features a prologue on sustainable construction, and includes new information on topics such as the collapse of the World Trade Center, sick building syndrome, and EIFS failures and how they could have been prevented. Allen also highlights the array of amazing new building materials now available, such as self-cleaning glass, photovoltaics, transparent ceramics, cloud gel, and super-high-strength concrete and structural fibers.Edward Allen makes it easy for everyone-from armchair architects and sidewalksuperintendents to students of architecture and construction-to understand the mysteries and complexities of even the largest building, from how it recycles waste and controls the movement of air, to how it is kept alive and growing.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2005", "edition": "3rd", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "285", "ISBN10": "0739465902", "ISBN13": "9780739465905", "file": "PDF, 16.54 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/511825", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/511825/f3b5ad"},

This collection of sketches aims to provide this insight. Here for the first time, a wide range of world famous architects' sketches from the Renaissance to the present day can be seen in a single volume. The sketches have been selected to represent the concepts or philosophies of the key movements in architecture in order to develop an overall picture of the role of the sketch in the development of architecture. The book illustrates the work of designers as diverse as Andrea Palladio, Erich Mendelsohn, Sir Edwin Lutyens, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Le Corbusier, Michelangelo, Alvar Aalto, Sir John Soane, Francesco Borromini, Walter Gropius, and contemporary architects Tadao Ando, Zaha Hadid and Frank Gehry to name but a few.

The book covers a variety of scales of graphic design, everything from portfolio design and competition boards, to signage and building super-graphics \u2013 to address every phase of architectural production.  This book combines and expands on information typically found in graphic design, information design, and architectural graphics books. As architectural communication increases to include more territory and components of a project, it is important for designers to be knowledgeable about the various ways in which to communicate visually. For instance, signage should be designed as part of the process \u2013 not something added at the end of a project; and the portfolio is a manifestation of how the designer works, not just an application to sell a design sensibility. In thinking about architecture as a systematic and visual project, the graphic design techniques outlined in this book will help architects process, organize and structure their work through the lens of visual communication. Each chapter is titled and organized by common architectural modes of communication and production. The chapters speak to architects by directly addressing projects and topics relevant to their work, while the information inside each chapter presents graphic design methods to achieve the architects\u2019 work. In this way, readers don\u2019t have to search through graphic design books to figure out what\u2019s relevant to them \u2013 this book provides a complete reference of graphic techniques and methods most useful to architects in getting their work done.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2015", "publisher": "Routledge", "language": "english", "pages": "222 / 223", "ISBN10": "0415522617", "ISBN13": "9780415522618", "file": "PDF, 85.00 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3487715", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3487715/e9f297"},

Built in the heyday of modernism, from the 1930s through the early 1960s, these houses were designed by exceptional architects for themselves or for adventurous clients. A few were preserved as time capsules, but most endured years of neglect or abuse and might easily have been torn down.\n\r\nWebb explores how these houses were created-- as daring experiments or as creative responses to site and climate-- and the research and effort that went into their restoration. Included here are villas that fuse craft and invention, machines for living, and residences that embrace the landscape. Here, too, are houses inspired by the purity of classical temples, and frugal dwellings that have been sensitively enlarged. After a long eclipse, these houses and the enlightened attitudes they embody are being rediscovered by creative individuals searching for distinctive, open, light-filled places to live. Modernism is a way of living, more than a style, and this book celebrates the architects and owners who respect its character and scale.\n\r\nAlso included are nearly 200 photographs taken by Roger Straus, all of which were specially commissioned for this book.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2001", "publisher": "Universe", "language": "english", "pages": "223 / 113", "file": "PDF, 18.65 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5269728", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5269728/eb2a21"},

This book shows crossfire of examples of international designers, which have drafted houses with many considerations in mind. Adaptation to the terrain and the climate, the budget and the needs of its future inhabitants has been born in mind. As well the homes three indispensable areas (the kitchen, bathroom and bedroom) have been focused. For example the bathroom is presented in multifarious variations: Either a functional space is apart or it can occupy a privileged spot alongside the garden, with large windows, spread itself out inside the house to such and extent that the bathtub turns into an indoor swimming pool.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2005", "publisher": "daab", "language": "english", "pages": "396", "ISBN10": "3937718060", "ISBN13": "9783937718064", "file": "PDF, 265.66 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1054195", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1054195/e6bcd0"},

This book\u2014itself designed with graphic modularity and richly illustrated with examples of forms created by nature and by man, including some remarkable and surprising architectural structures developed by the author\u2014leads the designer in this \"natural\" direction, beyond the familiar limitations of the right angle and the cube and into a richer world of forms based on the triangle, the hexagon, and general polyhedra, as well as saddle polyhedra spanned by minimal continuous surfaces.\n\r\nThe author writes that \"Systems can be envisaged which consist of some minimum inventory of component types which can be alternatively combined to yield a great diversity of efficient structural form. We call these minimum inventory/maximum diversity systems.\n\r\n\"By such a 'system' I mean a minimized inventory of component types (a kit of parts) along with rubrics whereby the components may be combined.... The snowflake is the most graphic example in nature of the minimum inventory/maximum diversity principle. In fact, it may be considered an archetype of physicogeometric expression. All planar snow crystals are found to have star-like forms with six corners (or subsets thereof).... However, within this six-fold form, no two snowflakes have ever been known to be exactly alike....\r\n\"An integral part of the concept of minimum inventory/maximum diversity systems is the principle of conservation of resources. The formative processes in natural structure are characteristically governed by least-energy responses. Perhaps the simplest expression of this is found in the principle of closest packing, a principle which even in its most elementary form is common in both the animate and inanimate worlds.\"\n\r\nPearce's work follows in the tradition established by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson and Konrad Wachsmann, and reflects his earlier close working association with Charles Eames and Buckminster Fuller. With Eames, he contributed to the design of seating and other furniture systems, and he edited the preliminary text of Fuller's Synergetics, that grand summary of his thoughts, and prepared the illustrations for the published version of that book.\n\r\nMany of the ideas explored in this book have already undergone \"reduction to practice\" in the firm Pearce founded, Synestructics, Inc. Its initial products have been kits and kites, and a ministructure large enough for kids to crawl through, the \"Curved Space Labyrinth,\" a saddle polyhedra system made of transparent plastic. Adult-sized structures, and indeed megastructures, based on these principles can be realized as soon as entrepreneurs emerge whose vision is commensurate with that of Peter Pearce.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "1978", "publisher": "MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "262", "ISBN10": "0262160641", "ISBN13": "9780262160643", "file": "PDF, 22.60 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2957272", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2957272/db9587"},

She asserts that certain sociopolitical and cultural trends now crucial to our understanding of historical transformations in both the West and the world of Islam were mirrored in the fair's architecture. Furthermore, dominant attitudes toward cross-cultural exchanges were revealed repeatedly in Westerners' responses to these pavilions, in Western architects' interpretations of Islamic stylistic traditions, and in the pavilions' impact in such urban centers.Although the world's fairs claimed to be platforms for peaceful cultural communication, they displayed the world according to a hierarchy based on power relations. \u00c7elik's delineation of this hierarchy in the exposition buildings enables us to understand both the adversarial relations between the West and the Middle East, and the issue of cultural self-definition for Muslim societies of the nineteenth century.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "1992", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "130", "ISBN10": "0520074947", "ISBN13": "9780520074941", "file": "PDF, 23.11 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1264810", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1264810/42629e"},

Large in scale, its rolling, densely lit nightscape suggests the pockets of heavy population that spread out from downtown. In fact, most people from LA don\u2019t actually live there, but in a suburb.The result of all this suburban living is a hugely diverse residential area with spectacular houses in the hills and canyons, surrounded by trees and stunning views of the city. This book examines some of the highlights of domestic living around Los Angeles, and points out some of the major influences: Art Deco, Spanish, and contemporary architecture; spacious, light-filled rooms; and plenty of wood, steel and concrete. It examines how the city\u2019s flamboyant past has shaped the landscape, as well as how cutting-edge architects and interior designers continue to create exciting new styles and structures. Acclaimed architects such as Richard Meier are featured here along with firms such as Bobrow Thomas & Associates, Legorreta and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.

Through a groundbreaking new paradigm of ''restorative environmental design,'' award-winning author Stephen R. Kellert proposes a new architectural model of sustainability.In Building For Life, Kellert examines the fundamental interconnectedness of people and nature, and how the loss of this connection results in a diminished quality of life.This thoughtful new work illustrates how architects and designers can use simple methods to address our innate needs for contact with nature. Through the use of natural lighting, ventilation, and materials, as well as more unexpected methodologies-the use of metaphor, perspective, enticement, and symbol-architects can greatly enhance our daily lives. These design techniques foster intellectual development, relaxation, and physical and emotional well-being. In the works of architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Eero Saarinen, Cesar Pelli, Norman Foster, and Michael Hopkins, Kellert sees the success of these strategies and presents models for moving forward.

When correctly\r\napplied, good artificial architectural lighting has a natural quality that instinctively feels right and\r\nhelps us to feel good. The need for lighting design rather than lighting that fulfils the regulatory and\r\nstatutory requirements began half a century ago.\r\nRCHITECTURAL LIGHTING DESIGN BEGAN to get noticed in the 1950s in the United States and later\r\nspilled over to the UK and some other European countries. Lighting design is a fairly new job\r\ndescription. There aren\u2019t many courses to enroll in if one wants to become a lighting designer. Not\r\nbeing able to influence what is taught in the few courses available leads many lighting design\r\nconsultancies to educate their own future lighting designers. In fact, some consultancies prefer to\r\nfoster their own talent to assure a good-quality basic training paired with a design philosophy that\r\nmatches the company\u2019s philosophy. Many lighting designers have either a design or architecture\r\nbackground and received their basic education and finishing at a consultancy. I myself am a product\r\nof this process and all I know has either been learned on the job or self-taught. Now, I have started to\r\nshare my knowledge and experience with the newcomers arriving at our consultancy.\r\nThis book is aimed at all new starters and the interested alike, and will hopefully become a\r\nfoundation for architects and future lighting designers. Therefore, this book covers the technical\r\naspects of lighting design as much as design-related features. The structure of the book allows a\r\nperson not familiar with lighting to get a step-by-step introduction to lighting design. It starts with the\r\nbasics of lamps and luminaires and the lighting tools available. These three first chapters form the\r\ntechnical groundwork of the book. The fourth chapter is the core of the book and explores the key\r\naspects of lighting design, while the fifth chapter demonstrates what deliverables are expected and\r\nhow to present them. All explanations are backed up by images and diagrams throughout, though most\r\nof the architectural images used in this book have been saved for the final chapter. Rather than\r\nfinishing with case studies of successfully executed jobs, this book closes with pitfalls, as a\r\nsuccessful lighting design scheme depends as much on well-executed details and the avoidance of\r\npitfalls as it does on its overarching concept.\r\nThis book will not teach you how to be creative and come up with a great lighting concept, but it\r\ndoes offer the tools and advice to create the structure of knowledge and the safety net you undoubtedly\r\nwill need to do so.", "categories": "Arts - Architecture", "year": "2018", "edition": "1", "publisher": "THE CROWOOD PRESS", "language": "english", "pages": "340", "ISBN13": "9781785004582", "file": "PDF, 35.27 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5680535", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5680535/6b25c4"},

Fiensy", "Greg Pak", "Fred Van Lente"], "rating": "0", "description": "Ignite the Soul: The Art of Figure Drawing contains everything you need to learn to master the challenge of drawing the human figure. Uniting concepts from Chinese calligraphy and Western traditional art, Han Dai-Yu maps out a step-by-step approach suitable for both established artists looking to transcend their current approach and novices looking for a way to begin.   Part One: The Fundamentals. Gesture drawing, proportion, measurement, balance, rhythm and the concept of mass and space are all explored to help the artist loosen up.   Part Two: Anatomy. Emphasis is placed on how to construct the muscles and bones from the standpoint of an artist as opposed to a scientist.   Part Three: Advanced Drawing Techniques.  Beyond the primary focus on structure and value, the last section entertains students with Chinese parables in an effort to take them beyond daily practice and to a place where they can bridge the gaps in their own technique and learn to explore themes.   Ignite the Soul is an excellent tool for teaching technical skills, while also recognizing, supporting, and encouraging the creative spirit and artistic process.   Illustrated entirely with drawings rendered by the author to demonstrate the oneness of theory and practice.  Han Dai-Yu received his B.F.A. and M.F.A. from the China National Academy of Art. From 2001-02, Dai-Yu prevailed as an Artiste dans la Residence et La Cite Internationale des Arts Paris and then spent 2002-06 in the U.S.A as a visiting scholar and artist. He was the founder of a Chinese Comprehensive Art program and taught drawing and painting classes for over ten years. His volumes on drawing and painting are published by the China National Academy Press and Taipei International Cultural Publishing House. His solo exhibitions have been housed in many international locations, including the Shanghai Art Museum and Museum of Chinese Painting Institute in Shanghai, La Cite Internationale des Arts Paris, and the LA Contemporary Art Gallery in Los Angeles.

Everyone knows that whatever the skin color, nationality, or religion, every human being uses the same tools for perception, for memory, and for reasoning. Everyone knows that a logically true statement is true in English, German, or Hindi. Everyone knows that when a Chinese and an American look at the same painting, they see the same painting.  But what if everyone is wrong?  When psychologist Richard E. Nisbett showed an animated underwater scene to his American students, they zeroed in on a big fish swimming among smaller fish. Japanese subjects, on the other hand, made observations about the background environment -- and the different \"seeings\" are a clue to profound underlying cognitive differences between Westerners and East Asians. For, as Professor Nisbett shows in The Geography of Thought, people actually think about -- and even see -- the world differently because of differing ecologies, social structures, philosophies, and educational systems that date back to ancient Greece and China and that have survived into the modern world. As a result, East Asian thought is \"holistic\" -- drawn to the perceptual field as a whole and to relations among objects and events within that field. By comparison to Western modes of reasoning, East Asian thought relies far less on categories or on formal logic; it is fundamentally dialectic, seeking a \"middle way\" between opposing thoughts. By contrast, Westerners focus on salient objects or people, use attributes to assign them to catergories, and apply rules of formal logic to understand their behavior.    The Geography of Thought documents Professor Nisbett's groundbreaking international research in cultural psychology, a series of comparative studies both persuasive in their rigor and startling in their conclusions, addressing questions such as:  \u2022 Why did the ancient Chinese excel at algebra and arithmetic, but not geometry, the brilliant achievement of such Greeks as Euclid?  \u2022 Why do East Asians find it so difficult to disentangle an object from its surroundings?  \u2022 Why do Western infants learn nouns more rapidly than verbs, when it is the other way around in East Asia?  \u2022 What are the implications of these cognitive differences for the future of international politics? Do they support a Fukuyamaesque \"end of history\" scenario or a Huntingtonian \"clash of civilizations\"?  From feng shui to metaphysics, from comparative linguistics to economic history, a gulf separates the children of Aristotle from the descendants of Confucius. At a moment in history when the need for cross-cultural understanding and collaboration have never been more important, The Geography of Thought offers both a map to that gulf and a blueprint for a bridge that might be able to span it.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2003", "publisher": "Free Press", "language": "english", "pages": "288 / 275", "ISBN10": "0743216466", "ISBN13": "9780743216463", "file": "PDF, 1.51 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/940403", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/940403/7e20a4"},

Students and Producers who have wanted to learn music theory to improve their own music, but have been intimidated by traditional approaches, music notation, and abstract concepts will find this book to be the answer they have been looking for.From the Author:\"How music theory is usually taught is unfair. It starts with the assumption that you can read music and understand the language of classical music. My book leaves all of that behind - focusing only on the MIDI grid that producers are already familiar with to learn all the key concepts of music theory, and ultimately, make better music.\"This book covers all the fundamentals of music theory, but is written using the language of the DJ and Producer - the MIDI Grid. It includes \"analysis\" projects that look at the harmonic and melodic ideas in songs by popular producers including Zedd, Boards of Canada, Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Bonobo, Richie Hawtin, Moby, Skrillex, and Aphex Twin.Praise for Music Theory for Electronic Music Producers:\"Aspiring electronic musicians have choices to make when it concerns their own education and training. This text makes one choice much easier: start here and get learning, quickly. Grounded and easygoing, the book uses real-world examples to help you make sense of music's inner worksings while steering clear of dense theories.\"- Michael J.

In it he explores how profoundly music is shaped by its time and place, and he explains how the advent of recording technology in the twentieth century forever changed our relationship to playing, performing, and listening to music.Acting as historian and anthropologist, raconteur and social scientist, he searches for patterns\u0097and shows how those patterns have affected his own work over the years with Talking Heads and his many collaborators, from Brian Eno to Caetano Veloso. Byrne sees music as part of a larger, almost Darwinian pattern of adaptations and responses to its cultural and physical context. His range is panoptic, taking us from Wagnerian opera houses to African villages, from his earliest high school reel-to-reel recordings to his latest work in a home music studio (and all the big studios in between).Touching on the joy, the physics, and even the business of making music, How Music Works is a brainy, irresistible adventure and an impassioned argument about music\u2019s liberating, life-affirming power.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2012", "publisher": "McSweeney's", "language": "english", "pages": "352", "ISBN10": "1936365537", "ISBN13": "9781936365531", "file": "EPUB, 3.27 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1305398/20bee9"},

The reality is, no matter what you think Jay-Z is, he first and foremost a business.  And as much as Martha Stewart or Oprah, he has turned himself into a lifestyle. You can wake up to the local radio station playing Jay-Z's latest hit, spritz yourself with his 9IX cologne, slip on a pair of his Rocawear jeans, lace up your Reebok S. Carter sneakers, catch a Nets basketball game in the afternoon, and grab dinner at The Spotted Pig before heading to an evening performance of the Jay-Z-backed Broadway musical Fela! and a nightcap at his 40/40 Club. He'll profit at every turn of your day. But despite Jay-Z's success, there are still many Americans whose impressions of him are foggy, outdated, or downright incorrect. Surprisingly to many, he honed his business philosophy not at a fancy B school, but on the streets of Brooklyn, New York and beyond as a drug dealer in the 1980s. Empire State of Mind tells the story behind Jay-Z's rise to the top as told by the people who lived it with him- from classmates at Brooklyn's George Westinghouse High School; to the childhood friend who got him into the drug trade; to the DJ who convinced him to stop dealing and focus on music. This book explains just how Jay-Z propelled himself from the bleak streets of Brooklyn to the heights of the business world. Zack O'Malley Greenburg draws on his one-on-one interviews with hip-hop luminaries such as DJ Clark Kent, Questlove of The Roots, Damon Dash, Fred \"Fab 5 Freddy\" Brathwaite, MC Serch; NBA stars Jamal Crawford and Sebastian Telfair; and recording industry executives including Craig Kallman, CEO of Atlantic Records. He also includes new information on Jay-Z's various business dealings, such as: *  The feature movie about Jay-Z and his first basketball team that was filmed by Fab 5 Freddy in 2003 but never released. *  The Jay-Z branded Jeep that was scrapped just before going into production. *  The real story behind his association with Armand de Brignac champagne. *  The financial ramifications of his marriage to Beyonce. Jay-Z's tale is compelling not just because of his celebrity, but because it embodies the rags-to-riches American dream and is a model for any entrepreneur looking to build a commercial empire.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Portfolio / Penguin", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "1591843812", "ISBN13": "9781591843818", "file": "EPUB, 316 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1227944/ad1916"},

When the fire fell in early April 1906 it would spread from what a Los Angeles newspaper referred to as a \"tumble down shack.\" to the four corners of the earth.

Beginning with the primordial sounds of nature, we have experienced an ever-increasing complexity of our sonic surroundings.

The author contends that we now suffer from an overabundance of acoustic information and a proportionate diminishing of our ability to hear the nuances and subtleties of sound. Our task, he maintains, is to listen, analyze, and make distinctions.  As a society we have become more aware of the toxic wastes that can enter our bodies through the air we breathe and the water we drink. In fact, the pollution of our sonic environment is no less real. Schafer emphasizes the importance of discerning the sounds that enrich and feed us and using them to create healthier environments. To this end, he explains how to classify sounds, appreciating their beauty or ugliness, and provides exercises and \"soundwalks\" to help us become more discriminating and sensitive to the sounds around us.

The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That\u2019s how this extraordinary autobiography began.\r\nOver the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humor, and originality found in his songs.\r\nHe describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger, and darkness that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as \u201cThe Big Bang\u201d: seeing Elvis Presley\u2019s debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work, and shows us why the song \u201cBorn to Run\u201d reveals more than we previously realized.\r\nBorn to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen, but this book is much more than a legendary rock star\u2019s memoir.

Yet such disruption always comes at a price. Spotify Teardown contests the tired claim that digital culture thrives on disruption. Borrowing the notion of \u201cteardown\u201d from reverse-engineering processes, in this book a team of five researchers have playfully disassembled Spotify's product and the way it is commonly understood.Spotify has been hailed as the solution to illicit downloading, but it began as a partly illicit enterprise that grew out of the Swedish file-sharing community. Spotify was originally praised as an innovative digital platform but increasingly resembles a media company in need of regulation, raising questions about the ways in which such cultural content as songs, books, and films are now typically made available online.Spotify Teardown combines interviews, participant observations, and other analyses of Spotify's \u201cfront end\u201d with experimental, covert investigations of its \u201cback end.\u201d The authors engaged in a series of interventions, which include establishing a record label for research purposes, intercepting network traffic with packet sniffers, and web-scraping corporate materials. The authors' innovative digital methods earned them a stern letter from Spotify accusing them of violating its terms of use; the company later threatened their research funding. Thus, the book itself became an intervention into the ethics and legal frameworks of corporate behavior.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2019", "publisher": "The MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "288", "ISBN10": "0262038900", "ISBN13": "9780262038904", "file": "EPUB, 18.46 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3697457/b025ad"},

It basically follows a two-part plan: (1) Teach a new, highly detailed sonata construction terminology, from the smallest parts to parts of whole movements and (2) show how these interrelate most of the time, and why certain instances break the supposed norms (based on the styles of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, which are very much alike and MOSTLY complimentary). It starts with showing how various types of opening phrases are built, and how these relate and differ to later phrases or themes introduced (all the various kinds are gone through thoroughly). This then leads into a discussion of the nature of the development and recapitulation, and ends up discussing each of the normal \"sonata-style\" movement forms separately. \rI think this is a wonderful book both for musicologists and would-be composers (you'll probably need to develop your own exercises on the way, but when you are ready to deal with a book like this, you should handle that). It can probably be read by the enlightened dilettante, but unless you are willing to spend the amount of time needed to recognize each element while listening, I think the book is most useful for people who are actually working with music on paper. Performers who are not put off by theoretical discussions could probably benefit from it as well. \rThe book uses functional harmonic theory in the vein of Sch\u00f6nberg and Riemann. In my native Norway this method is a lot more widely used than Schenkerian analysis, so I haven't had any problems with it; I've understood that some American readers may have to spend a little time adapting, though. My only gripe with the book is that the terminological material presented is vast and, while I am in no position to suggest improvements, feels like it could have been simplified. This is a minor inconvenience, but the rewards of the book are so great that it's definitely worth the time to go through it that extra time just to get it all down. \rAny other caveats? There's two, both minor ones. First of all, all referential notes are printed in the back of the book. I usually like to read all of these, so I prefer that they are printed on the page where they are relevant; Saves me a lot of page flipping. The other point is that this book leaves out a large part of sonata theory: Texture. Although some very general observations are made, such as the fact that Alberti Bass and similar procedures usually are first introduced in transition passages (p. 125), texture isn't mentioned much. This book is primarily about melody and it's harmonic foundation. Which, of course, is fine. For what it is, it is a wonderful book, and one would be deluded to think that you could cram everything there is to know about sonata theory into 250 pages.  \rFor the interested reader I'd also like to add Charles Rosen's Sonata Forms as a complimentary read: While this is a book very focused on terminology and isolation and fragmentation of sonata elements, Rosen's book take a much more prosaic road, in the vein of sir Donald Francis Tovey. I am just about to start on Hepokosky/Darcy's book Elements of Sonata Theory; Hopefully I will soon be able to add it to my recommended list.  \rHowever, I have to withhold one star. Why? Before I bought the book from Amazon, I borrowed it from the library. Comparing the two versions, the newer versions have significantly worse print quality than the older prints. The font is thicker, heavier and slightly less pleasing, but this isn't much of a problem. What IS annoying though is the quality of the note examples. I don't want to believe it, but it honestly look like OUP decided they needed to reprint this book, but had lost the original digital version, so they simply photocopied an earlier book and copied the scans. Both the stems and the bar lines are of varying thickness, and sometimes look slightly bent, and the whole score looks more blurred, and harder on the eye. I don't know why it came to be that way, but it appears totally meaningless, since the earlier print looked perfect. As far as I can see there's been no changes whatsoever in content.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "1998", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "320", "ISBN10": "0195104803", "ISBN13": "9781423759218", "file": "PDF, 30.00 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/648297", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/648297/440859"},

For the most part it has a concrete focus, and draws examples from many films and scenes to substantiate its main points. The book does not assume any prior knowledge of music, and where necessary, makes only a cursory mention of prominent aspects of music  to enhance the reader's understanding of the main ideas presented.

The author comes across as extremely knowledgable and passionate about her subject, and any true movie lover would really enjoy reading this book.  \rThe only weak point of this book is the chapter on \"theory\" behind film music. Replete with the kind of obsessive musings one might expect of graduate seminars in the humanities, this chapter has little relevance, if any, to the everyday world of film music.

Some examples are analyzed throughout. Most are left for the student to analyze. These books reflect Leon Stein's impressive background as student, musician, and composer. Stein studied composition with Leo Sowerby, Frederick Stock (conductor of the Chicago Symphony), and orchestration with Eric DeLamarter, his assistant. He earned M. Mus and Ph.D degrees at DePaul University and was associated with its School of Music as director of the Graduate Division and chairman of the Department of Theory and Composition until his retirement in 1976.

This is great for quickly learning songs by yourself or with an ensemble. Each song in a fake book only has a single melody actually written out in notes, which is usually the vocal or lead melody. This melody will have the lyrics written beneath the notes, with each word aligned to its corresponding note. Above the notes of the melody will appear the names of the appropriate chords to play - for example, a \"C minor\" chord would be written as \"Cmin\" or Cm\", rather than writing out all of the notes in those chords as they appeared in the original version of the song.Hero Songbird Gravy Waltz Falling In Love Again (Can't Help It) All For Love Abc Aba Daba Honeymoon Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Positive Theme From 'schindler's List' Circle Of Life From 'the Lion King'Can You Feel The Love Tonight From 'the Lion King'Beautiful In My Eyes Jesse Ordinary Miracles The Colour Of My Love See You In September After The Love Has Gone Goodnight My Love, Pleasant Dreams Forrest Gump - Main Title (Feather Theme) The Name Game Ain't No Mountain High Enough Ain't She Sweet Ain't We Got Fun?

This will save you many hours of practice time, and provide solid starting point to explore the best of each tonality. \n\r\nThroughout the book, many songs which use the ideas being described are linked to via youtube so you can hear the musicians you love applying the concepts in popular songs \n\r\nThe author makes this publication available as a free, full colour .pdf when you buy the Kindle or Paperback edition, allowing you to print off the exercises and to make the book accessible to readers with earlier Kindle models. Details are inside. \n\r\nAll in all, this is a structured and practical approach to learning the most important aspects of modern guitar music theory in a hands on and musical environment. The emphasis is on playing the theory, not just knowing it so it will keep you creative for years to come. \n\r\nThe book includes 7 studio quality backing tracks, one for each mode that have been specially written by Guitar Techniques Magazine contributor Jacob Quistgaard - aka 'Quist'", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2014", "edition": "Paperback", "publisher": "CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform", "language": "english", "pages": "106 / 108", "ISBN10": "1503319210", "file": "PDF, 33.03 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3711126", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3711126/f305ae"},

Whether they write for a small group of friends or in the hopes of creating a smash hit, aspiring songwriters can learn how to focus on topics essential to their success in this competitive field; every songwriter must be aware of audience, thick-skinned enough to handle rejection and competition, and most importantly have the confidence to master the craft of composing and producing.

Chapters explore loop-based harmonic patterns, tone tendencies, form, function, and lyric writing, all in service of preparing the aspiring songwriter to be a master of prosody and keen in understanding the relationship between words and music.

And how do Chopin's works exploit the non-Euclidean geometry of musical chords?   In this groundbreaking work, author Dmitri Tymoczko describes a new framework for thinking about music that emphasizes the commonalities among styles from medieval polyphony to contemporary rock. Tymoczko identifies five basic musical features that jointly contribute to the sense of tonality, and shows how these features recur throughout the history of Western music. In the process he sheds new light on an age-old question: what makes music sound good? A Geometry of Music provides an accessible introduction to Tymoczko's revolutionary geometrical approach to music theory. The book shows how to construct simple diagrams representing relationships among familiar chords and scales, giving readers the tools to translate between the musical and visual realms and revealing surprising degrees of structure in otherwise hard-to-understand pieces.    Tymoczko uses this theoretical foundation to retell the history of Western music from the eleventh century to the present day. Arguing that traditional histories focus too narrowly on the \"common practice\" period from 1680-1850, he proposes instead that Western music comprises an extended common practice stretching from the late middle ages to the present. He discusses a host of familiar pieces by a wide range of composers, from Bach to the Beatles, Mozart to Miles Davis, and many in between. A Geometry of Music is accessible to a range of readers, from undergraduate music majors to scientists and mathematicians with an interest in music. Defining its terms along the way, it presupposes no special mathematical background and only a basic familiarity with Western music theory.

For example, Justin Bieber, who is now a multimillionaire due to his musical success, got his start by uploading videos onto a popular content sharing site. If that is not enough to convince you that you don't have to be rich to become a great musical artist, there is not much that will! \n\r\nHave you been dreaming of being a musician, yet your budget does not permit you to spend loads of money on studio time. Are you browsing the net for your recording studio or music production?\n\r\nDo you wish there was some way to record your music without worrying about the inconvenience of finding a studio in your local area? Are you working with a limited budget but your musical drive is working on high speed? \n\r\nIf you are someone who has a passion for music and you have been seeking a place to release all of your creativity then it would probably be in your best interest to build your own recording studio.\n\r\nThis guide will give you practical insider tips on the \u2018ins\u2019 and \u2018outs\u2019 of building your own home recording studio, buying music recording software and recording studio equipment. Topics like music production, free recording software, mastering, and the use of microphones, studio headphones, studio monitors, audio recording and audio mixing are all covered in this book.\n\r\nAmong the topics discussed are:\n\r\n\u2022Learning To Mix\r\n\u2022Creating A Solid Plan\r\n\u2022Creating A Budget \r\n\u2022Choosing A Space\r\n\u2022Designing Your Space\r\n\u2022Working On The Acoustics\r\n\u2022Soundproofing Your Space\r\n\u2022Buying A Computer\r\n\u2022Choosing The Best Recording Software\r\n\u2022Selecting The Best Interface\r\n\u2022Microphone Buying Tips\r\n\u2022Great Advice For Buying Headphones\r\n\u2022Accessories You Must Buy\r\n\u2022Audio Cable DOs and DON'Ts\n\r\nThere are many places in a home that can serve as a recording studio, but this all depends on several factors.

It's not like you can't get another book to teach you the ins and outs of different styles, or how to put chords together into pleasing progressions, or how to read standard notation, or rhythm patterns for improvisation. There are literally THOUSANDS of books on such topics, which would have made it idiotic for the author to try to treat them when the goal was to provide something that IS NOT elsewhere available (as far as I know)- a one-stop reference for virtually every possible scale, mode, and chord possible, annotated with visuo-spatial diagrams that not only display everything highly intuitively, but in a way that could be understood by someone who is not only bereft of skills in music notation but FUNCTIONALLY ILLITERATE. That's right, if I ever have an autistic kid I am going to hand them a hundred dollar Casio and this book and create myself a keyboard idiot savant.  \rIn fact, if you are CREATIVE, and EXPERIMENTAL, you can figure out quite a bit from this book alone, especially with modern keyboards providing automatic rhythms, etc. I started playing keyboard a year and a half ago, having NO PRIOR MUSICAL TRAINING, and this was the first book I used, being an intellectual masochist. In about two weeks, I knew more about scales and modes and chords than anybody I know probably ever will. Granted, when I say \"people I know\" I am talking about people hanging around a coffee shop, not a conservatory of music, but still. I started out by just messing around. I saw that there were charts showing which chords went with which scales so I just started playing those chords in the left hand and those scales in the right hand, just messing around. For instance, next to the chart for the major scale it says that it goes with major chords. So I looked to see which major chords were included in the scale, which is C, F, and G in the key of C. I played around, fingering different scales and varying rhythm, recorded some stuff, and listened to it. Some of it started sounding kind of similar to stuff I've heard.  \rI've had a lot of fun repeating this process over and over and \"unlocking\" the sounds that are \"frozen\" in different chords and scales. I haven't learned to read music yet (well, beyond All Cows Eat Grass and all that) and don't know any songs, yet still, I am capable of ripping off solos that have people going \"WTF\" and am capable of recording an infinite amount of recorded music (if I need a new song, I just pick a new scale, or mode of that scale, and start pecking away). Lately I have also begun playing some of the patterns out of the Pop Piano Book, so I can learn accompaniment styles and rhythms, and I am also thinking about getting The Classical Fake Book so I can study up on some sick melodies.  \rSo really, I don't usually write reviews, but I wanted to write one here so that the book could get up to four and a half stars. I think by reading my review you can tell whether or not this is for you. I wholeheartedly recommend buying this book if you are a composer or improviser who didn't get lucky in life and who either didn't get to go to college or had to study something practical while they were there, and couldn't study something so trivial as music. Really, this is a college level instruction in a single book. Spend a few minutes a day with this, and maybe a supplemental book to teach you whatever styles you are interested in, and you might surprise yourself with how intuitive this all gets.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "1993", "publisher": "Carl Fischer Music Publisher", "language": "english", "pages": "206", "ISBN10": "0825826799", "ISBN13": "9780825826795", "file": "PDF, 30.34 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/740200", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/740200/1e441b"},

The author is saying to you \"No matter what; you have got to be motivated if you really want to learn!!\" I suppose this is true of anything and he gets his point across quickly. Within the first 10 pages I was already much better at sight reading than I was from completing a beginner/intermediate guidebook with musical notation AND tablature. I never tried to learn to read the music and I made it through the entire book and \"learned\" all the lessons. The fact that this book doesn't allow you to cheat AT ALL is an enormous plus. I also disagree with the comments that the music to be learned isn't interesting or pleasant; while it is obviously geared toward driving home certain skills and concepts, many of the tunes are quite pleasant and fun to play with others on their own merit. As I state below record one part and play the duets as they were meant to be played. They are quite nice and have a \"classical\" feel.Criticisms:A lot of the music provided to learn comes in \"duet\" form for 2 guitars which complicates things for a loner like me. I recommend getting a music recording program for your computer so you can record one part and play the other and vice-versa. All this of course to the time of a metronome. Without understanding timing this book won't help you as much as it can. I also wish he was more explicit about the time he wants you to play some of the pieces in. He'll note that it's \"moderate\" but  my metronome has several moderato settings... which should I use? A minor detail to be sure.I've noticed that the 1st book sold separately comes with a DVD I wish this one came with that DVD. Perhaps I'll buy it separately.Also, as others have stated the binding isn't very good, so go to Kinkos and get that done, you won't regret it. And finally,supplement this book with some \"fun\" guitar playing. Get a book that plays some songs you may know and has some charisma and CD accompaniment. I recommend Hank Marvins guitar instruction book Hank Marvin's Guitar Instruction Book.

I emphatically disagree on a number of accounts!  First, this was written to be used as a textbook and people should keep that in mind when reading it.  You are reading it to learn things that presumably you do not know.  Second, Schoenberg takes a very compositional approach to teaching Harmony, which in my opinion is great for numerous reasons, chiefly because you actually get to apply the rules/principles in a meaningful way, which aids memorization and enjoyment.  Prior to buying this book I had purchased Kostka's and Payne's \"Tonal Harmony\" which is as dull as can be, as they make you do numerous exercises which are of little value and even littler enjoyment.  Furthermore, they introduce too much too fast.  What I mean by this is that they teach you piles of stuff and then have you apply as much of it as possible to as few cases as possible.  Schoenberg takes a different tact by having the student make their own exercises, to which he provides some basic guidelines, and for every new concept introduced a new exercise is required.  By forcing you to make your own assignments you really internalize the information and it becomes more than just facts (e.g. this chord is constructed in this manner, that chord is constructed in that manner). You get the sense with Schoenberg that you are studying composition as opposed to just theory. \rHowever, there is one drawback to Schoenberg's text, it is excessively wordy and there is a lot of needless philosophizing in it (that is why I give this edition 4 stars).  However, there are editions of the book that \"trim all the fat\" so to speak.  I found a copy at my school's library and it is an absolute gem. It gets right to the point and if you are lucky you can find a copy on some online used bookstores.  This shortened edition was translated by Robert D.W. Adams and was published by the Philosophical Library, New York, 1948; it is 336 pages and has officially become my Bible.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "1978", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "455", "ISBN10": "0520034643", "ISBN13": "9780520034648", "file": "PDF, 23.12 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/685791", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/685791/ae1785"},

It will give a lower note if placed farther away. -- A hole will give a higher note if made larger. It will give a lower note if smaller.

You can \"lower\" the note by using a smaller hole or by placing the hole farther from the mouthhole.\u00a0It also means you can change the hole size and its placement without changing the note.

Instead, in a daring stroke, Greil Marcus selects ten songs recorded between 1956 and 2008, then proceeds to dramatize how each embodies rock \u2019n\u2019 roll as a thing in itself, in the story it tells, inhabits, and acts out\u0097a new language, something new under the sun.\u0093Transmission\u201d by Joy Division. \u0093All I Could Do Was Cry\u201d by Etta James and then Beyonc\u00e9. \u0093To Know Him Is to Love Him,\u201d first by the Teddy Bears and almost half a century later by Amy Winehouse. In Marcus\u2019s hands these and other songs tell the story of the music, which is, at bottom, the story of the desire for freedom in all its unruly and liberating glory. Slipping the constraints of chronology, Marcus braids together past and present, holding up to the light the ways that these striking songs fall through time and circumstance, gaining momentum and meaning, astonishing us by upending our presumptions and prejudices.

Vinh", "Ingrid Monson"], "rating": "0", "description": "Renowned Polish composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fran\u00e7ois Chopin (1810-1849) composed an amazing variety of compositions including some 50 mazurkas, 25 preludes, 24 etudes, 21 nocturnes, 17 waltzes, 11 polonaises, 4 ballades and 3 sonatas. Chopin's E minor and F minor Piano Concertos, however, are particularly  important as they played a vital role in his career as a composer-pianist.  Chopin: The Piano Concertos, written by Chopin expert John Rink - recipient  of a Ph.D. from Cambridge University for his thesis The Evolution of  Chopin's `Structural Style' and its Relation to Improvisation in May, 1989  - provides an engaging, comprehensive analysis of these concertos as well  as providing vital information about the environment in which these  Concertos were composed and how they were received. The author's  multifaceted exploration of these concertos successfully provides the  reader with a sound understanding of Chopin's Piano Concertos as well as  offering a deeper appreciation for his work and his genius. As well as  including Chopin's E minor and F minor Piano Concertos, the book is  complete with an in-depth analysis of Chopin's enigmatic `third concerto',  the Allegro de concert. Before going into Chopin's Piano Concertos,  the author sets the tone for the book by noting that \"Chopin's piano  concertos have enjoyed enormous popularity ever since their composition ...  but they have also suffered some of the harshest scholarly criticism  inflicted on his works\". He rebuttals with, \"... when viewed as music to be  performed rather than scores to be dissected on paper, they belong to  [Chopin's] most successful creations\". He offers this book as \"[an attempt]  to set the record straight, re-evaluating the concertos against the early  nineteenth-century traditions that shaped them so that their many  outstanding qualities can be better appreciated.\"  In his first  chapter, appropriately titled \"Creation\", the author explains the great  significance of the Piano Concertos to Chopin's evolution as a musician. He  describes the creation of Chopin's F minor Concerto, Chopin's newly found  commitment to a virtuoso career, the creation of the E minor Concerto, and  offers a brief introductory analysis of the parallels between these two  concertos. He goes on to describe the first performances, first reviews and  first editions of these concertos, explaining the general acceptance of  Chopin as a genius in the musical community, yet also the criticism Chopin  faced introducing a creativity that was often mistaken as a weakness. The  chapter continues with an overview of the publication of these concertos  and concludes with an insightful section titled \"Chopin as teacher\",  outlining Chopin's teaching practices and depicting a connection between  the glosses in scores used by Chopin's pupils and associates and Chopin's  own playing and teaching styles. Before reevaluating the concertos,  the author provides a chapter titled \"Interpretation\", summarizing Chopin's  incredibly diverse reception over the past 150 years and providing an  inclusive summary of reactions from noted critics, composers, editors and  performers. These reactions include, among others, those of critics Ludwig  Rellstab, Gottfried Fink, J. W. Davidson, and those of composers Schumann  and Liszt. An analysis of Frederick Nieck's influential biography of Chopin  - the first scholarly monograph on Chopin - and its impact on society and  influence on future authors assessing the concertos is also included. The  author continues with a description of the trials and tribulations in the  musical scores of these concertos, explaining the evolution of the scores  from first edition to later versions, collected editions, editions with  second-piano accompaniment, full scores, transcriptions and arrangements  and finally re-orchestrations. The chapter concludes with a discussion  titled \"Performers\", a very interesting and informative section considering  Chopin's first two concertos are available on over seventy recordings each,  performed by most concert pianists throughout the twentieth century. The  author describes an appeal from several of Chopin's former students - Lenz,  Mikuli and Princess Marcelina Czartoryska - that Chopin's concertos had  been misinterpreted, and goes on to further debate the interpretations of  Chopin's music.  Having successfully prepared the readers, author  John Rink goes on to offer his own re-evaluation of the two concertos.  Beginning my explaining the principles and premises by which music is  evaluated, he describes his narrative approach in the analytical  re-evaluation of Chopin's concertos:\"I shall first define each  movement's skeletal structure, identifying important `stabilizing' features  such as tonal scheme and sectional form, and then in tracing through the  music I shall observe temporally defined processes like the generation and  relaxation of momentum, rhythmic flux, and small- and large-scale gestural  impulse, all of which help to transform the structural bedrock into a  living musical statement.\"He goes on to do just that, providing 17 pages  of analysis on Chopin's Opus 21 and a subsequent 22 pages of analysis on  Opus 11. He cautions that \"words can never fully capture musical  experience: its temporal course and emotional impact ultimately lie beyond  the powers of verbal description\" and continues by stating that \"the  foregoing analytical re-evaluation is in one sense another futile attempt  to encapsulate the concertos in words, but at least it has been undertaken  in a spirit of appreciation, not denigration. If nothing else, it has  revealed the utter hollowness of Nieck's criticisms and those of his  successors\". Finally, the fifth and final chapter \"Chopin's third  concerto\" explores Chopin's third concerto, the Allegro de concert... Unlike the other two concertos, the  author concludes that the current evaluation of this concerto is quite fair  and states:\"it may be a legitimate interpretation, sure to be superseded  in due course, but for the time being enlightening some aspect of the  music's elusive meaning while leaving space for fresh evaluations to  come.\"The nature of this book is somewhat complex, however this book  appeals not only to the music scholar but also to the music enthusiast. The  comprehensive, informative and engaging nature of the book alone is  sufficient to give it purpose, however, the heart of this book really lies  in the re-evaluation of Chopin's first two concertos. John Rink set out to  set the records straight, and succeeded to do so in an analytic and  objective manor. As a devoted admirer of Chopin's work myself, having  listened to Chopin everyday during the entire 9 month term before my birth  and having learned to play his pieces since the age of 3, I find deep  emotion, passion and genius in Chopin's work. However, to write a book such  as this one takes a vast scholastic understanding of music and Chopin in  particular, and John Rink is certainly qualified to do so. Previously I had little knowledge of these concertos, however I'm sure that even if I had, I  would still have found this book to be very valuable, as I'm sure many  others have and will. It is a valuable and much needed contribution to the  study of Chopin.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "1997", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "149", "ISBN10": "0521446600", "ISBN13": "9780511611636", "file": "PDF, 4.41 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/690651", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/690651/972b3a"},

Fifty of the world's most respected scholars cast opera as a fluid entity that continuously reinvents itself in a reflection of its patrons, audience, and creators. The synergy of power, performance, and identity recurs thematically throughout the volume's major topics: Words, Music, and Meaning; Performance and Production; Opera and Society; and Transmission and Reception. Individual essays engage with repertoire from Monteverdi, Mozart, and Meyerbeer to Strauss, Henze, and Adams in studies of composition, national identity, transmission, reception, sources, media, iconography, humanism, the art of collecting, theory, analysis, commerce, singers, directors, criticism, editions, politics, staging, race, and gender. The title of the penultimate section, Opera on the Edge, suggests the uncertainty of opera's future: is opera headed toward catastrophe or have social and musical developments of the last hundred years stimulated something new and exciting, and, well, operatic?

But music's tendency to deconstruct itself combined with the complexities of postmodernism doom him to failure. This is the parable that frames The Sense of Music, a novel treatment of music theory that reinterprets the modern history of Western music in the terms of semiotics.Based on the assumption that music cannot be described without reference to its meaning, Raymond Monelle proposes that works of the Western classical tradition be analyzed in terms of temporality, subjectivity, and topic theory. Critical of the abstract analysis of musical scores, Monelle argues that the score does not reveal music's sense. That sense--what a piece of music says and signifies--can be understood only with reference to history, culture, and the other arts. Thus, music is meaningful in that it signifies cultural temporalities and themes, from the traditional manly heroism of the hunt to military power to postmodern \"polyvocality.\"This theoretical innovation allows Monelle to describe how the Classical style of the eighteenth century--which he reads as a balance of lyric and progressive time--gave way to the Romantic need for emotional realism. He argues that irony and ambiguity subsequently eroded the domination of personal emotion in Western music as well as literature, killing the composer's subjectivity with that of the author. This leaves Dr. Strabismus suffering from the postmodern condition, and Raymond Monelle with an exciting, controversial new approach to understanding music and its history.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2000", "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "265", "ISBN10": "069105715X", "ISBN13": "9780691057156", "file": "PDF, 1.05 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/540378", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/540378/2a6b6c"},

Muir", "Linda Criddle", "Patrick O. Cohrs"], "rating": "0", "description": "Fugue for J. S. Bach was a natural language; he wrote fugues in organ toccatas and voluntaries, in masses and motets, in orchestral and chamber music, and even in his sonatas for violin solo. The more intimate fugues he wrote for keyboard are among the greatest, most influential, and best-loved works in all of Western music. They have long been the foundation of the keyboard repertory, played by beginning students and world-famous virtuosi alike. In a series of elegantly written essays, eminent musicologist Joseph Kerman discusses his favorite Bach keyboard fugues--some of them among the best-known fugues and others much less familiar. Kerman skillfully, at times playfully, reveals the inner workings of these pieces, linking the form of the fugues with their many different characters and expressive qualities, and illuminating what makes them particularly beautiful, powerful, and moving.  These witty, insightful pieces, addressed to musical amateurs as well as to specialists and students, are beautifully augmented by a CD with new performances made specially for this volume. In addition to the complete scores for all the music discussed in the book, the CD features Karen Rosenak, piano, playing two preludes and fugues from  TheWell-Tempered Clavier --C Major, book 1; and B Major, book 2--and recordings by Davitt Moroney of the Fughetta in C Major, BWV 952, on clavichord; the Fugue on \"Jesus Christus unser Heiland,\" BWV 689, on organ; and the Fantasy and Fugue in A Minor, BWV 904, on harpsichord.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2005", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "198", "ISBN10": "0520243587", "ISBN13": "9780520243583", "file": "PDF, 2.16 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/612307", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/612307/505254"},

He traces the evolution of folk and ritual instruments to tools of entertainment and art, the rise of a professional class of singers and musicians, and the musical revolution that flowered during the Renaissance. Sachs chronicles the foundation of the modern orchestra during the baroque period and its subsequent development, concluding with the modern-day rise of electric and jazz instruments.A pleasure to read as well as a valuable resource, this classic work is enhanced with 24 plates and 167 illustrations.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2006", "publisher": "Dover Publications", "language": "english", "pages": "560", "ISBN10": "0486452654", "ISBN13": "9780486452654", "file": "MOBI , 14.14 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3404034/e89f77"},

When Motley Crue was at the height of its fame, there wasn't any drug Nikki Sixx wouldn't do. He spent days - sometimes alone, sometimes with other addicts, friends, and lovers - in a coke and heroin-fueled daze. The highs were high, and Nikki's journal entries reveal some euphoria and joy. But the lows were lower, often ending with Nikki in his closet, surrounded by drug paraphernalia and wrapped in paranoid delusions.  Here, Nikki shares those diary entries - some poetic, some scatterbrained, some bizarre - and reflects on that time. Joining him are Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Mick Mars, Slash, Rick Nielsen, Bob Rock, and a host of ex-managers, ex-lovers, and more.  Brutally honest, utterly riveting, and shockingly moving, The Heroin Diaries follows Nikki during the year he plunged to rock bottom - and his courageous decision to pick himself up and start living again.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Simon and Schuster", "language": "english", "pages": "160", "ISBN13": "9780743486286", "file": "EPUB, 3.67 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/994690/2bb2b6"},

Part one focuses on technical development and explains the most efficient approach to study and practice. Part two should go along with part one and it presents the elements of music and procedures for developing ability to sight-read and memorize. It also introduces the visualization concept.

Yet Wagner's absolutely central position in the operatic canon continues. This volume serves as a timely reminder of his ongoing musical, cultural, and political impact. Contributions by specialists from such varied fields as musical history, German literature and cultural studies, opera production, and political science consider a range of topics, from trends and problems in the history of stage production to the representations of gender and sexuality.

Beginning with a discussion of the century's vital inheritance from late-romantic operatic traditions in Germany and Italy, the text embraces fresh investigations into various aspects of the genre in the modern age, with a comprehensive coverage of the work of individual composers from Debussy and Schoenberg to John Adams and Harrison Birtwistle. Traditional stylistic categorizations (including symbolism, expressionism, neo-classicism and minimalism) are reassessed from new critical perspectives, and the distinctive operatic traditions of Continental and Eastern Europe, Russia and the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and United States are subjected to fresh scrutiny. The volume includes essays devoted to avant-garde music theatre, operettas and musicals, filmed opera, and ends with a discussion of the position of the genre in today's cultural marketplace.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2006", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "428", "ISBN10": "0521783933", "ISBN13": "9780521783934", "file": "EPUB, 1.26 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2933029/80a226"},

Musicians, engineers, and producers laughed and cried at the crazy goings-on they'd never imagined - or recognized all too well. Now Mixerman turns his razor-sharp gaze to the art of mixing and gives followers and the uninitiated reason to hope - if not for logic and civility in the recording studio then at least for a good sounding record. With a firm commitment to art over technology and to maintaining a grasp of each, Mixerman outlines his own approach to recording success, based on his years mixing records in all genres of music for all kinds of artists, often under trying circumstances. As he states in his introduction to the new volume, \"Even if you're not a professional mixer, even if you're a musician trying to mix your own work or a studio owner in a smaller market, you have your own set of pressures to deal with while you're mixing. Regardless of what those pressures are, it's important to identify and recognize them, if for no other reason than so you can learn to completely ignore them.\" But how? \"That's where the Zen comes in.\"", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Hal Leonard", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "1423491505", "ISBN13": "9781423491507", "file": "EPUB, 726 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1170711/c1b85d"},

Contrary to popular belief, headbangers and the music they love are more alive than ever. Yet there has never been a comprehensive book on the history of heavy metal - until now. Featuring interviews with members of the biggest bands in the genre, Sound of the Beast gives an overview of the past 30-plus years of heavy metal, delving into the personalities of those who created it. Everything is here, from the bootlegging beginnings of fans like Lars Ulrich (future founder of Metallica) to the sold-out stadiums and personal excesses of the biggest groups. From heavy metal's roots in the work of breakthrough groups such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin to MTV hair metal, courtroom controversies, black metal murderers and Ozzfest, Sound of the Beast offers the final word on this elusive, extreme, and far-reaching form of music.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2004", "publisher": "It Books", "language": "english", "pages": "416", "ISBN10": "0380811278", "ISBN13": "9780380811274", "file": "EPUB, 9.41 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2032126/6946c3"},

Zappa worked in a musical realm unfamiliar to many radio listeners. Today, his music can be appreciated as a whole, emerging as a coherent, thoughtful, innovative\u2014if somewhat daunting\u2014body of work. Lowe has left no aspect of that work unexamined, from Zappa's role as a satirist of the highest order, to his place in the genre of progressive rock, and his importance as one of the foremost critics of American culture and society. Zappa's messages\u2014musical and lyrical\u2014may not always be clear, but they are well worth considering.The volume begins with a discussion of Zappa's role as a satirist and a discussion of his musical style, and then proceeds to a prolonged examination of his albums. Through this extended engagement with Zappa's music, a surprisingly clear perspective on his personal views is also provided, shedding light on his treatment of such topics as the falsified notion of love in popular culture, the compromising influence of money on popular music, and the concept of freedom in a systematized society, among other things. The book also features an official discography and a bibliographic essay that discusses the current state of Zappa scholarship.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2006", "publisher": "Praeger", "language": "english", "pages": "280", "ISBN10": "0275987795", "ISBN13": "9780313054570", "file": "PDF, 1.13 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/819270", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/819270/337649"},

Thirty years later, the music made in Laurel Canyon continues to pour from radios, iPods, and concert stages around the world. During the canyon's golden era, the musicians who lived and worked there scored dozens of landmark hits, from \"California Dreamin'\" to \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\" to \"It's Too Late,\" selling tens of millions of records and resetting the thermostat of pop culture.In Laurel Canyon, veteran journalist Michael Walker tells the inside story of this unprecedented gathering of some of the baby boom's leading musical lights--including Joni Mitchell; Jim Morrison; Crosby, Stills, and Nash; John Mayall; the Mamas and the Papas; Carole King; the Eagles; and Frank Zappa, to name just a few--who turned Los Angeles into the music capital of the world and forever changed the way popular music is recorded, marketed, and consumed.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2006", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "Faber & Faber", "language": "english", "pages": "317", "ISBN10": "0571211496", "ISBN13": "9780571211494", "file": "PDF, 5.12 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

Written by leading scholars in opera studies today, this Companion offers a wide-ranging guide to a rapidly expanding field of study and new ways of thinking about a rich and intriguing art form, placing opera back at the centre of our understanding of Western culture over the past 400 years.

It will also be useful for the student who has experience of music notation and the desire for a stronger foundation in the rudiments of music. This book covers basic notation of pitch and rhythm, major and minor keys, intervals, triads, and the tonal context of harmony. Students will also learn how to compose short rhythm examples, melodies in major and minor keys, and a 24-measure piece for piano, exploring the principles of melody and harmony. This book is intended to supplement the classroom experience. The study of music theory requires two basic components: the study of theory and the application of theory through the listening experience. This book supplies the former, the basics of music theory. The application of theory through listening will be provided in the classroom. It is the hope of the author that the merely theoretical will be brought to life in the experience of music, and for this the work of the instructor in a beginning theory class is crucial. Understanding how chords, intervals, meters, key signatures, and melodies work can only be meaningful when they explicate the listening, performing, and composing experience of music. The study of theory is a desiccated endeavor when it does not answer questions about how we listen to, and experience, music.", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "2018", "edition": "3rd", "publisher": "Kendall Hunt", "language": "english", "pages": "211", "ISBN13": "9781524972790", "file": "PDF, 142.23 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3680290", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3680290/d05484"},

The author approaches orchestration from the premise that the principles can best be presented by analysis of music as it has been written.The essentials of instrument combination discussed here are those which can be observed operating in the scores of great composers from Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven down to our own day.    Orchestration is notable for the clarity and logic of its organization. From a consideration of the individual instruments and their technical problems the author skillfully develops his analysis of orchestration, covering his analysis of orchestration, covering instrumentation of primary and secondary melodies, part-writing, chords, and contrapuntal techniques. Finally, he discusses typical problems in orchestration together with some examples of their solutions.

Delany"], "rating": "0", "description": "From its  beginnings in hip hop culture, the dense rhythms and aggressive lyrics of rap music have made it a provocative fixture on the American cultural landscape. In Black Noise:  Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America, Tricia Rose, described by the New York Times  as a \"hip hop theorist,\" takes a comprehensive look at the lyrics, music, cultures, themes, and styles of this highly rhythmic, rhymed storytelling and grapples with the most salient issues and debates that surround it.Assistant Professor of Africana Studies and History at New York University, Tricia Rose sorts through rap's multiple voices by exploring its underlying urban cultural politics, particularly the influential New York City rap scene, and discusses rap as a unique musical form in which traditional African-based oral traditions fuse with cutting-edge music technologies. Next she takes up rap's racial politics, its sharp criticisms of the police and the government, and the responses of those institutions. Finally, she explores the complex sexual politics of rap, including questions of misogyny, sexual domination, and female rappers' critiques of men.But these debates do not overshadow rappers' own words and thoughts. Rose also closely examines the lyrics and videos for songs by artists such as Public Enemy, KRS-One, Salt N' Pepa, MC Lyte, and L. L. Cool J. and draws on candid interviews with Queen Latifah, music producer Eric \"Vietnam\" Sadler, dancer Crazy Legs, and others to paint the full range of rap's political and aesthetic spectrum. In the end, Rose observes, rap music remains a vibrant force with its own aesthetic, \"a noisy and powerful element of contemporary American popular culture which continues to draw a great deal of attention to itself.\"", "categories": "Arts - Music", "year": "1994", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Wesleyan University Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0819562750", "ISBN13": "9780819562753", "file": "EPUB, 1.06 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1116721/82159a"},

Where does this order and regularity come from? As Philip Ball reveals in Nature's Patterns: A Tapestry in Three Parts, this order creates itself. The patterns we see come from self-organization. Indeed, scientists have found that there is a pattern-forming tendency inherent in the basic structure and processes of nature, whether living or non-living, so that from a few simple themes, and the repetition of simple rules, endless beautiful variations can arise.\nPart of a trilogy of books exploring the science of patterns in nature, Shapes looks at how shapes form. From soap bubbles to honeycombs, delicate shell patterns, and even the developing body parts of a complex animal like ourselves, the author uncovers patterns in growth and form in all corners of the natural world, explains how these patterns are self-made, and describes why similar shapes and structures may be found in very different settings, orchestrated by nothing more than simple physical forces.

Exercises included at the end of each unit have students undertake such creative assignments as writing short progressions of various types and harmonizing melodies with unfigured/figured bass lines.      Each unit includes 10 to 40 musical examples--brief excerpts that illustrate the specific harmonic and voice-leading techniques discussed at that point.

This is a textbook for the study of music theory, using a historical approach which enables the student to learn about compositional devices as they appeared and evolved in early Western music. The textbook and its accompanying workbook provide for the study of basic analytical and compositional techniques through the use of selected literature and original compositional techniques through the use of selected literature and original compositional assignments. With these teaching materials techniques which have been employed periodically throughout history, even into the most advanced of contemporary composition, may be mastered and absorbed as an integral part of the student's understanding of the aesthetic principles of art. Such compositional techniques as canon, cadential patterns, isorhythm, cantus firmus, initiation, and invertible counterpoint are among the many which are presented for study.    A unique feature of the text is the introduction and employment of early notations. Including this dimension helps the student to understand the limitations imposed by the graphic tools of the composer upon his compositional decisions. This approach also enables the student to develop flexibility in the interpretation of notation.    The book has been used in a preliminary form by hundreds of students and many different types of teachers. The students were typical college freshmen and sophomores, and none of the faculty had special training in the music of the periods studied, since any teacher with conventional theoretical training can easily master and present the material.

Through this volume a team of scholars and writers on opera examine those important Romantic operas which embraced the Shakespearean sweep of tragedy, history, love in time of conflict, and the struggle for national self-determination. Rival nations, rival religions and violent resolutions are common elements, with various social or political groups represented in the form of operatic choruses. The book traces the origins and development of a style created during an increasingly technical age, which exploited the world-renowned skills of Parisian stage-designers, artists, and dancers as well as singers. It analyses in detail the grand operas by Rossini, Auber, Meyerbeer and Hal\u00e9vy, discusses grand opera in Russia and Germany, and also in the Czech lands, Italy, Britain and the Americas.

When Leo Fender\u2019s tiny firm marketed the first solid-body electric guitar, the Esquire, musicians immediately saw its appeal. Not to be out-maneuvered, Gibson, the largest guitar manufacturer, raced to build a competitive product. The company designed an \u201caxe\u201d that would make Fender\u2019s Esquire look cheap and convinced Les Paul\u2014whose endorsement Leo Fender had sought\u2014to put his name on it. Thus was born the guitar world\u2019s most heated rivalry: Gibson versus Fender, Les versus Leo.\n\r\nWhile Fender was a quiet, half-blind, self-taught radio repairman from rural Orange County, Paul was a brilliant but egomaniacal pop star and guitarist who spent years toying with new musical technologies. Their contest turned into an arms race as the most inventive musicians of the 1950s and 1960s\u2014including bluesman Muddy Waters, rocker Buddy Holly, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Eric Clapton\u2014adopted one maker\u2019s guitar or another.

Spanning nearly 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism, this unprecedented anthology showcases the evolution and continuing influence of one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s. Think of it as ''Hip-Hop 101.''    Assembled with great care by Mark Anthony Neal, hailed as ''one of the most brilliant cultural critics of his generation'' (Chicago Sun Times), and fellow hip-hop scholar Murray Forman,  That's the Joint is the first to attempt to present the most important hip-hop scholarship in one comprehensive volume.  Presented thematically, the selections address the history of hip-hop, identity politics of the ''hip-hop nation,'' debates of ''street authenticity,'' gender, revolutionary politics, aesthetics, technologies of production, hip-hop as a cultural industry, and much more.    The articles presented here display a diverse array of concerns, illuminating hip-hop in its broadest conception as both a musical and cultural practice.  Among the more than forty texts collected in the volume, you will find critiques of groundbreaking recordings like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's ''The Message'' and Public Enemy's ''It Takes a Nation to Hold Us Back,'' some of the earliest commentary on B-Boys break dancing and DJs sampling, and serious responses to key moments and controversies from the 2 Live Crew obscenity trial to gangsta rap to the movement of hip-hop into commercial and academic spheres.

Arbus comes startlingly to life on these pages, a strong-minded child of disconcerting originality who grew into a formidable photographer of unflinching courage. Arbus forged an intimacy with her subjects that has inspired generations of artists. Arresting, unsettling, and poignant, her photographs stick in our minds. Why did these people fascinate her? And what was it about her that captivated them?It is impossible to understand the transfixing power of Arbus\u2019s photographs without exploring her life. Lubow draws on exclusive interviews with Arbus\u2019s friends, lovers, and colleagues; on previously unknown letters; and on his own profound critical insights into photography to explore Arbus\u2019s unique perspective and to reveal important aspects of her life that were previously unknown or unsubstantiated. He deftly traces Arbus\u2019s development from a wealthy, sexually precocious free spirit into first, a successful New York fashion photographer and then, a singular artist who coaxed secrets from her subjects. Lubow reveals that Arbus\u2019s profound need not only to see her subjects but to be seen by them drove her to forge unusually close bonds with these people, helping her discover the fantasies, pain, and heroism within each of them, and leading her to create a new kind of photographic portraiture charged with an unnerving complicity between the subject and the viewer.Diane Arbus: Portrait of a Photographer brushes aside the clich\u00e9s that have long surrounded Arbus and her work.

If you enjoy photography and you have, or plan to have a compact digital camera, this book is for you. If you do not yet have a compact digital camera, this book can still be valuable to you because it will help you learn which camera features are likely to be important to you, thus enabling you to buy the right camera for your needs the first time.Not all that long ago, skilled professionals like woodworkers, jewelers, sculptors, and other creative or skilled professionals learned their trade by becoming an apprentice.As an apprentice, you learned the body of knowledge you needed for your profession by working right next to a master on real projects. If you were learning to be a furniture maker, you might first build a small, simple piece of furniture, and then build increasingly larger and more complex pieces until you knew what you needed to know to make just about any kind of furniture you wanted to make.Undoubtedly, being an apprentice and working with a master was a real luxury that isnot often available today. However, the notion of working with a master on specific projects is the basis of this book and others in this series. The premise is that you can effectively and quickly learn how to take great photos by following step-by-step techniques - just as you would do if you were working as an apprentice next to a master photographer.After you've successfully completed twenty or thirty techniques in this book, you'll beamazed at the \"body of knowledge\" you will have gained and how much better your photos will be.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2003", "publisher": "Wiley Pub", "language": "english", "pages": "340", "ISBN10": "076452500X", "ISBN13": "9780764525001", "file": "PDF, 13.09 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/461052", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/461052/788db9"},

Focusing on the immense photographic output of the Salpetriere hospital, the notorious Parisian asylum for insane and incurable women, Didi-Huberman shows the crucial role played by photography in the invention of the category of hysteria. Under the direction of the medical teacher and clinician Jean-Martin Charcot, the inmates of Salpetriere identified as hysterics were methodically photographed, providing skeptical colleagues with visual proof of hysteria's specific form. These images, many of which appear in this book, provided the materials for the multivolume album Iconographie photographique de la Salpetriere.As Didi-Huberman shows, these photographs were far from simply objective documentation. The subjects were required to portray their hysterical \"type\" - they performed their own hysteria. Bribed by the special status they enjoyed in the purgatory of experimentation and threatened with transfer back to the inferno of the incurables, the women patiently posed for the photographs and submitted to presentations of hysterical attacks before the crowds that gathered for Charcot's \"Tuesday Lectures.Charcot did not stop at voyeuristic observation. Through techniques such as hypnosis, electroshock therapy, and genital manipulation, he instigated the hysterical symptoms in his patients, eventually giving rise to hatred and resistance on their part. Didi-Huberman follows this path from complicity to antipathy in one of Charcot's favorite\"cases,\" that of Augustine, whose image crops up again and again in the Iconographie. Augustine's virtuosic performance of hysteria ultimately became one of self-sacrifice, seen in pictures of ecstasy, crucifixion, and silent cries.

Through color-coded chapters, it distinguishes between the variety of lenses, cameras, supports, lighting, software and studio equipment available to the contemporary digital photographer.  Technical aspects of three-dimensional scanning and post-production image enhancement are also covered using precise charts, graphs, formulas, and sample images.  A helpful glossary and list of resources are included at the end.\n\r\nThe sensibly structured approach of Adrian Davies' writing is somewhat dry but comprehensible and quite logical.  His insight clues us in to how to modify the macro process depending upon the specific type of subject matter being photographed.  He manages to de-mystify such concepts as depth-of-field, histograms, image size and camera settings in an intelligible manner.  Of particular interest are examples that delineate ultraviolet fluorescence, imaginative backlighting, polarized light, and image sequencing.  Whether used by a professional for scientific documentation or by an amateur for purely creative endeavors, //Close-up and Macro Photography// is a valuable reference that could save time, effort and money for anyone involved in this particular field.\r\nReviewed by Richard Mandrachio", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Focal Press", "language": "english", "pages": "189", "ISBN10": "0240812123", "ISBN13": "9780240812120", "file": "PDF, 10.45 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/647276", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/647276/76a6d6"},

From ancient Sumer to Christianity, from the Maya civilization to Buddhism, there\u2019s hardly a human society over the ages that hasn\u2019t associated trees with some sort of celestial and religious power.\n\r\nDue to its expressive quality and natural branching scheme, trees have also become important communication tools, illustrating a variety of topics such as family ties, moral values, systems of law, domains of science, biological species, hard disk drives, database schemas, and online discussions.\n\r\nThe Book of Trees covers over 800 years of human culture through the lens of the tree figure, from its entrenched roots in religious medieval exegesis to its contemporary, secular digital themes. With roughly 200 images the book offers a visual evolutionary history of this universal metaphor, showing us the incremental adoption of a stylized, abstract construct, as well as a recent emergence of new visual models, many employing advanced computer-generated algorithms. Ultimately, this book makes visualization a prism through which to observe the evolution of civilization.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2014", "publisher": "Princeton Architectural Press", "language": "english", "pages": "208", "ISBN10": "1616892188", "file": "PDF, 17.37 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2866737", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2866737/ecb199"},

Souza captured nearly two million photographs of President Obama, in moments highly classified and disarmingly candid.\n\r\nObama: An Intimate Portrait reproduces more than 300 of Souza's most iconic photographs with fine-art print quality in an oversize collectible format. Together they document the most consequential hours of the Presidency--including the historic image of President Obama and his advisors in the Situation Room during the bin Laden mission--alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his encounters with children, interactions with world leaders and cultural figures, and more.\n\r\nSouza's photographs, with the behind-the-scenes captions and stories that accompany them, communicate the pace and power of our nation's highest office. They also reveal the spirit of the extraordinary man who became our President. We see President Obama lead our nation through monumental challenges, comfort us in calamity and loss, share in hard-won victories, and set a singular example to \"be kind and be useful,\" as he would instruct his daughters.\n\r\nThis book puts you in the White House with President Obama, and will be a treasured record of a landmark era in American history.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2017", "publisher": "Little, Brown and Company", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9780316512572", "file": "EPUB, 32.67 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3609096/736d7f"},

Learn to use it creatively, and you unlock the magic that transforms an ordinary subject into a work of art.

From the San Francisco Bay Area, its influence extended internationally, contributing significantly to the recognition of photography as a fine art. The group\u2014first identified as such in a 1932 exhibition\u2014was comprised of strongly individualist artists, brought together by a common philosophy, and held together in a tangle of dynamic relationships. They shared a conviction that photography must emphasize its unique capabilities\u2014those that distinguished it from other arts\u2014in order to establish the medium\u2019s identity. Their name, f.64, they took from a very small lens aperture used with their large format cameras, a pinprick that allowed them to capture the greatest possible depth of field in their lustrous, sharply detailed prints. In today\u2019s digital world, these \u201cstraight\u201d photography champions are increasingly revered.Mary Alinder is uniquely positioned to write this first group biography.

As almost every photographer knows, the word -photograph- has its roots in two Greek words that, together, mean -drawing with light.- But what is less commonly acknowledged and understood is the role that shadow plays in creating striking, expressive imagery, especially in portraiture. It is through deft, nuanced use of both light and shadow that you can move beyond shooting simply ordinary, competent headshots into the realm of creating dramatic portraiture that can so powerfully convey a subject's inner essence, communicate a personal narrative, and express your photographic vision. InThe Dramatic Portrait: The Art of Crafting Light and Shadow, Chris Knight addresses portraiture with a unique approach to both light and shadow that allows you to improve and elevate your own portraiture. He begins with the history of portraiture, from the early work of Egyptians and Greeks to the sublime treatment of light and subject by artists such as Caravaggio, Rembrandt, and Vermeer. Chris then dives into a deep, hands-on exploration of light, shadow, and portraiture, offering numerous lessons and takeaways. He covers: - The qualities of light: hard, soft, and the spectrum in between- The relationships between light, subject, and background, and how to control them- Lighting patterns such as Paramount, Rembrandt, loop, and split- Lighting ratios and how they affect contrast in your image- Equipment: from big and small modifiers to grids, snoots, barn doors, flags, and gels- Multiple setups for portrait shoots, including those that utilize one, two, and three lights- How color contributes to drama and mood, eliciting an emotional response from the viewer- How to approach styling your portrait, from wardrobe to background- The post-processing workflow, including developing the RAW file, maximizing contrast, color grading, retouching, and dodging and burning for heightened drama and effect- How all of these elements culminate to help you define your personal style and create your own narrative", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2017", "publisher": "Rocky Nook", "language": "english", "pages": "264", "ISBN10": "1681982145", "ISBN13": "9781681982144", "file": "EPUB, 46.97 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5247998/f62c14"},

Author Glenn Randall is an experienced wilderness photographer, and whether you want to venture into the mountains for once-in-a-lifetime shots of raw nature, or simply hone your landscape photography skills from the safety of your back deck, Randall explains the art, science and craft behind creating stunning landscape photographs.\n\r\nThis fully updated edition of the best-selling first edition includes nearly all new imagery throughout the book, as well as a new first chapter, \"Photographic Essentials,\" to help beginners to landscape photography get up to speed quickly. Additionally, this second edition takes into account how Randall's techniques have changed and evolved since the first edition published\u2015from photographic practices to how he uses smart phones and apps as important and powerful tools for landscape photography.\n\r\nAfter discussing photographic essentials, Randall focuses on the art of landscape photography. He describes his three-step process for composing a photograph and shows how good composition is an organic process that begins with rules but ultimately transcends them. Randall then explores the science behind successful landscape photographs, which requires understanding key concepts from geography, optics, vision, and psychology. These concepts include:\n\r\n    \u2022 How the position of the sun at sunrise and sunset varies throughout the year. This will help you plan when and where to shoot.\n\r\n    \u2022 Using optics to predict where rainbows will appear, how polarizers will interact with reflections, and where to find spectacular light.\n\r\n    \u2022 How to use topographic maps and computerized mapping tools to help you find promising shooting locations in the wilderness. \n\r\n    \u2022 Calculating exposures, achieving correct exposure in high-contrast lighting situations, and the best digital darkroom techniques.\n\r\nWith some practice and by applying the techniques that Randall teaches you, you will soon be ready to master the finer nuances of creating magnificent landscape photographs.\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nChapter 1: Photographic Essentials\r\nChapter 2: Landscape Photography Looks So Easy\r\nChapter 3: In Search of Extraordinary Landscapes\r\nChapter 4: Visualization\r\nChapter 5: The Art and Science of Light\r\nChapter 6: The Art and Science of Composing Compelling Images\r\nChapter 7: The Perfect Exposure\r\nChapter 8: Digital Capture and Processing of High-Contrast Scenes\r\nChapter 9: Take a Walk on the Wide Side\r\nChapter 10: The Landscape at Night\r\nChapter 11: The Psychology of the Compelling Landscape\r\nIndex", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2020", "edition": "2", "publisher": "Rocky Nook", "language": "english", "pages": "272", "ISBN10": "2019950812", "ISBN13": "9781681985671", "file": "EPUB, 87.74 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/7721367/d87450"},

Describing the power relations that sustain and make possible photographic meanings, Azoulay argues that anyone -- even a stateless person -- who addresses others through photographs or is addressed by photographs can become a member of the citizenry of photography. The civil contract of photography enables anyone to pursue political agency and resistance through photography. Photography, Azoulay insists, cannot be understood separately from the many catastrophes of recent history. The crucial arguments of her book concern two groups with flawed or nonexistent citizenship: the Palestinian noncitizens of Israel and women in Western societies. Azoulay analyzes Israeli press photographs of violent episodes in the Occupied Territories, and interprets various photographs of women -- from famous images by stop-motion photographer Eadweard Muybridge to photographs from Abu Ghraib prison. Azoulay asks this question: under what legal, political, or cultural conditions does it become possible to see and to show disaster that befalls those who can claim only incomplete or nonexistent citizenship? Drawing on such key texts in the history of modern citizenship as the Declaration of the Rights of Man together with relevant work by Giorgio Agamben, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Susan Sontag, and Roland Barthes, Azoulay explores the visual field of catastrophe, injustice, and suffering in our time.

Lenses and Focal lengths; Using a Fisheye Lens; Working with Macro Lenses; Understanding Exposure; ISO and Noise; Mulit-Raw Processing Beyond Landscapes; Shutter Speed and Motion; Exposing for the Earth and the Sky at Night; Seeing the unexpected; Photography That Tells a Story; Abstraction; Combining Images; Surrealism; Patterns; Framing; Black and White; Perspective, are just a few around 75 different topics covered. \rEach topic opens with a brief introduction followed by examples. It is illustrated throughout with the authors own colour photographs on virtually everyone of its 240 pages, and each photograph is accompanied by a brief explanation of what the photographer set out to do and how he achieved it, including the equipment and settings used, all this information is extremely useful. Sometimes comparative examples or steps are illustrated. The scope of the guide is vast, as is the variety of the pictures, so most should find something that appeals here. \rThe presentation is good, although I would have favoured a serif typeface for the text rather than the sans face chosen here, it does not make for ease of reading. Included is a Further Reading list, Glossary and Index.  \rCreative Composition is a useful book; but it is perhaps best taken in small doses, the danger, with with so much information covered in very short sections, one is tempted to cover too much in one go. What it does not do is discuss to any extent the use of photo-editing software, reference is made to Adobe Photoshop (it does not mention other software such as Corel Photo-Paint), but there is little here that explains how to use the software, nor does it explore many of the the creative possibilities of such software.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2009", "publisher": "Wiley", "language": "english", "pages": "242", "ISBN10": "0470527145", "ISBN13": "9780470527146", "file": "PDF, 37.81 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/647266", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/647266/79c0a0"},

The book starts off on the wrong foot, but then it becomes very useful beginning in Chapter 3.  It's clearly written, comprehensive and includes useful detail.  \rChapter 1 is a portfolio of the author's work.  Chapter 2 is about his multi-computer setup and all the hard drives he has in RAID arrays, etc.  Swell, but tell us what the practical needs are for amateurs and beginning pro's, please.  After looking at his portfolio and reading his gloat you're wondering whether this book is just an ego trip for Mr. Diallo.    \rBut in Chapter 3 he reviews color management and gets into the details about device profiles.   If you're reading about digital B&W you've probably already read about color management, but this book explains it better than anything else I've read.  Chapter 4 gets into examples of conversions from digital color to B&W.  There's good info on scanning and scanning software, which is an unexpected bonus if you have a collection of negatives from your pre-digital life. \rChapter 5 covers the use of Photoshop for B&W.  It summarizes the main tools photographers should learn and incluuds some examples of how to use them, and that chapter is as useful for color as it is for B&W.  Chapter 6 goes into the details on B&W printing, including the use for third part ink sets for Epson printers and the use of raster imaging processors (RIPs).  Again, the text is clearly written even as it goes into detail.  Chapter 7 covers digital workflow and includes a couple of useful end-to-end examples. There's an excellent discussion of why and how to use sharpening. Chapters 8 and 9  will be of interest to people interesting in selling their work. Chapter 8 on limited editions could be condensed to about 5 pages by removing redundant text, but it does contain clear and presumably useful advice.  Chapter 9 on building a portfolio is detailed and includes a short section on building a web site for displaying one's portfolio.  The advice is certainly useful for someone hoping to sell his or her work as fine art.  There's a good reference guide at the back with links to various sources of ink, paper, software, etc. \rThere are two flaws that should be corrected in a future update/new edition:  The most serious flaw is that the illustrations in the book are small and sometimes rather dark, so it's hard to verify the points Mr. Diallo makes in the text.  He even ackmowledges their shortcomings in thhe text.  The publisher could learn a lot from looking at the excellent quality of the illustrations printed in books on photography published by Rocky Nook.  Mr. Diallo posts full sized versions of the photos for download from the book's website, but each one has to be downloaded one at a time.   \rThat's really a kludge.  In a book about photography, the photos should be printed well enough so that the reader can see what Mr. Diallo is writing about!  And his examples should be on a CD included with the book so the reader can apply the lessons, especially the lessons in Chapter 5 about using Photoshop for Black & White.  The inadequately printed illustrations means 4 stars, not 5. \r(A minor quibble:  The text about a photo is often on the page before the photo itself. But that's a small matter compared to the poorly reproduced photos themselves.) \rThe second flaw is inevitable.  The book was published at the end of 2007 and it covers both software and hardware (printers, scanners, spectrophotometers) very well.  That information is getting out of date as of the end of 2009.  For example the author describes how to use Photoshop CS3, but the current version is CS4; the Epson 2400 has been replaced by the 2880 and the 3800 by the 3880.  It's not a problem for the next year or so (through 2010), but eventually the product-specific information will get stale.  Hopefully there will be a new edition -- maybe even one with well-reproduced illustrations and a CD.  \rStill, the techniques the author describes won't get stale, so if you're interested in digital B&W, this is a very good choice.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Course Technology PTR", "language": "english", "pages": "384", "ISBN10": "1598637584", "ISBN13": "9781598633757", "file": "PDF, 25.25 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/647466", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/647466/bf1c65"},

Kumaravadivelu"], "rating": "0", "description": "Cindy Sherman's Untitled Film Stills, a series of 69 black-and-white photographs created between 1977 and 1980, is widely seen as one of the most original and influential achievements in recent art. Witty, provocative and searching, this lively catalogue of female roles inspired by the movies crystallizes widespread concerns in our culture, examining the ways we shape our personal identities and the role of the mass media in our lives. Sherman began making these pictures in 1977 when she was 23 years old. The first six were an experiment: fan-magazine glimpses into the life (or roles) of an imaginary blond actress, played by Sherman herself. The photographs look like movie stills--or perhaps publicity pix--purporting to catch the blond bombshell in unguarded moments at home. The protagonist is shown preening in the kitchen and lounging in the bedroom. Onto something big, Sherman tried other characters in other roles: the chic starlet at her seaside hideaway, the luscious librarian, the domesticated sex kitten, the hot-blooded woman of the people, the ice-cold sophisticate and a can-can line of other stereotypes. She eventually completed the series in 1980. She stopped, she has explained, when she ran out of clichas.  Other artists had drawn upon popular culture but Sherman's strategy was new. For her the pop-culture image was not a subject (as it had been for Walker Evans) or raw material (as it had been for Andy Warhol) but a whole artistic vocabulary, ready-made. Her film stills look and function just like the real ones--those 8 x 10 glossies designed to lure us into a drama we find all the more compelling because we know it isn't real. In the Untitled Film Stills there are no Cleopatras, no ladies on trains, no women of a certain age. There are, of course, no men. The 69 solitary heroines map a particular constellation of fictional femininity that took hold in postwar America--the period of Sherman's youth and the starting point for our contemporary mythology. In finding a form for her own sensibility, Sherman touched a sensitive nerve in the culture at large. Although most of the characters are invented, we sense right away that we already know them. That twinge of instant recognition is what makes the series tick and it arises from Cindy Sherman's uncanny poise. There is no wink at the viewer, no open irony, no camp.  In 1995, The Museum of Modern Art purchased the series from the artist, preserving the work in its entirety. This book marks the first time that the complete series will be published as a unified work, with Sherman herself arranging the pictures in sequence.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2003", "publisher": "The Museum of Modern Art, New York", "language": "english", "pages": "164 / 166", "ISBN10": "0870705075", "ISBN13": "9780870705076", "file": "PDF, 132.72 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/855271", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/855271/9a1219"},

Focusing on an elite group of two dozen Soviet-Jewish photographers, including Arkady Shaykhet, Alexander Grinberg, Mark Markov-Grinberg, Evgenii Khaldei, Dmitrii Baltermants, and Max Alpert, Through Soviet Jewish Eyes presents a different picture. These artists participated in a social project they believed in and with which they were emotionally and intellectually invested-they were charged by the Stalinist state to tell the visual story of the unprecedented horror we now call the Holocaust.These wartime photographers were the first liberators to bear witness with cameras to Nazi atrocities, three years before Americans arrived at Buchenwald and Dachau. In this passionate work, David Shneer tells their stories and highlights their work through their very own images-he has amassed never-before-published photographs from families, collectors, and private archives.Through Soviet Jewish Eyes helps us understand why so many Jews flocked to Soviet photography; what their lives and work looked like during the rise of Stalinism, during and then after the war; and why Jews were the ones charged with documenting the Soviet experiment and then its near destruction at the hands of the Nazis.

For each, Bryan points out common pitfalls and then offers a simple solution, showing you how to approach the exposure differently and transform your shot.A complement to Understanding Exposure, Bryan Peterson\u2019s Exposure Solutions digs deeper to help you break bad habits, take control of your exposure, and approach even tricky situations with confidence.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "language": "english", "pages": "300", "file": "PDF, 12.04 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3055102", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3055102/00ffcd"},

It begins by setting out a number of basic skills: nude photography shares many of the same technical problems as other areas of portraiture, and developing a sound understanding of the basics is the key to success. Mike demonstrates a wide range of classic lighting techniques, from soft diffuse lighting for a romantic mood to contrasty lighting to emphasize the contours and musculature of the body. Knowing what poses are good for figure work is also essential: specially commissioned photographic sequences demonstrate the do's and don'ts. Once you've mastered these aspects, you're ready to move on to more creative shots such as semi-abstracts, mood-creating shots involving the use of props and backgrounds, and technical challenges such as infra-red or toned prints, and digital manipulations. Backed up with sound practical information, the shots shown here are guaranteed to inspire. Chapters on darkroom and digital know-how form the final reference section. Whether you work in colour or in black and white, using a traditional darkroom or a computer, this book is an inspiring and informative introduction to an ever-popular subject.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2002", "publisher": "David & Charles", "language": "english", "pages": "160 / 162", "ISBN10": "0715314556", "ISBN13": "9780715314555", "file": "PDF, 102.69 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/11223077", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/11223077/32f7c3"},

Much of this has been covered in some detail in other reviews. One thing I liked are some simple images of how to convey 3D form with light for solid shapes, which many other lighting books seem to overlook this basic concept. I also liked the portrait lighting images that breakdown separately each individual light (key, fill, rim) to show how each contributes to the overall image.\r\nA weakness in the book is the lack of an index in the back. Also, some example lighting diagrams showing how the lights are set up would be useful to explain how some images were lit.\r\nAnother issue, not just limited to this lighting text, is defining three-quarter (3/4)lighting. It seems to be contradictorily defined among different authors. This author seems to imply that it is similar to quarter (1/4) lighting which is a combination of front & side lighting. Other books distinguish 3/4 lighting to be a combination of front, side and TOP lighting which is the bases of creating 3D form in lighting in many cases. This text didn't have a directional term for front + side + top. \r\nAgain, I reiterate that overall, I think this is a good introductory book, but has some areas that could be improved, so I rated it 4-star instead of 5-star.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2007", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "AVA Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "178", "ISBN10": "2940373035", "ISBN13": "9782940373031", "file": "DJVU, 8.30 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2427966/c3c94b"},

However, until now, only a handful of Chinese books have made it onto historians' short lists. Yet China has a fascinating history of photobook publishing, and \"The Chinese Photobook\" will reveal for the first time the richness and diversity of this heritage. This volume is based on a collection compiled by Martin Parr and Beijing- and London-based Dutch photographer team WassinkLundgren. And while the collection was inspired initially by Parr's interest in propaganda books and in finding key works of socialist realist photography from the early days of the Communist Party and the Cultural Revolution era, the selection of books includes key volumes published as early as 1900, as well as contemporary volumes by emerging Chinese photographers. Each featured photobook offers a new perspective on the complicated history of China from the twentieth century onward. \"The Chinese Photobook\" embodies an unprecedented amount of research and scholarship in this area, and includes accompanying texts and individual title descriptions by Gu Zheng, Raymond Lum, Ruben Lundgren, Stephanie H.

No amount of digital wizardry can turn a badly composed image into a picture you would want to display.

Instead of plodding through long and complex pages of text, this book supplements the necessary information, such as the basics of the rule of thirds and how to get good highlights and shadows, with tons of gorgeous, full color images that actually show you what to do and how to do it, rather than just telling you what to try. You'll be amazed at the gorgeous images you'll create, whether your passion is for photographing your family, pets, travel adventures, nature, or anything else.*Beautiful design with full color images on every page which makes it much easier to remember everything you've learned once you're behind the camera  *Tip boxes spread throughout the book highlight the most essential information so you can get started right away making better images *Each chapter contains an easy-to-follow assignment to jumpstart your own creativity", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2011", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Focal Press (Elseiver)", "language": "english", "pages": "152", "ISBN10": "024081505X", "ISBN13": "9780240815053", "file": "PDF, 39.80 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1075562", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1075562/5c6c3b"},

We are all photographers now, with camera phones in hand and social media accounts at the ready. And we know which pictures we like. But what makes a \"good picture\"?

Soft-focus yearbook photos from the '80s are now hopelessly\u2015and happily\u2015outdated, as are the low-angle portraits fashionable in the 1940s or the blank stares of the 1840s. From portraits to products, landscapes to food pics, Good Pictures proves that the history of photography is a history of changing styles. In a series of short, engaging essays, Kim Beil uncovers the origins of fifty photographic trends and investigates their original appeal, their decline, and sometimes their reuse by later generations of photographers. Drawing on a wealth of visual material, from vintage how-to manuals to magazine articles for working photographers, this full-color book illustrates the evolution of trends with hundreds of pictures made by amateurs, artists, and commercial photographers alike.

Critic Lionel Trilling called it the \u201cmost realistic and most important moral effort of our American generation.\u201d The origins of Agee and Evan's famous collaboration date back to an assignment for\u00a0Fortune magazine, which sent them to Alabama in the summer of 1936 to report a story that was never published. Some have assumed that Fortune's editors shelved the story because of the unconventional style that marked\u00a0Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, and for years the original report was lost.But fifty years after Agee\u2019s death, a trove of his manuscripts turned out to include a typescript labeled \u201cCotton Tenants.\u201d Once examined, the pages made it clear that Agee had in fact written a masterly, 30,000-word report for Fortune.Published here for the first time, and accompanied by thirty of Walker Evans\u2019s historic photos, Cotton Tenants is an eloquent report of three families struggling through desperate times. Indeed, Agee\u2019s dispatch remains relevant as one of the most honest explorations of poverty in America ever attempted and as a foundational document of long-form reporting. As the novelist Adam Haslett writes in an introduction, it is \u201ca poet\u2019s brief for the prosecution of economic and social injustice.\u201dCo-Published with The Baffler magazine", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Melville House", "language": "english", "pages": "224", "ISBN10": "1612192122", "ISBN13": "9781612192123", "file": "EPUB, 7.36 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2210140/b636f0"},

Thanks again!\" --Leanne, professional model, Los Angeles\n\r\n\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,\" wrote both Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci, and this book exalts the simple, foundational rules of epic model photography.\n\r\nThe overarching philosophy of this straightforward guide is that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words,\u201d and thus the photo-packed book shows as much as it tells! And too, another philosophy of the tome is that women are naturally beautiful, thusly requiring minimal retouching when the photograph is lit and composed in an optimum manner. After all, the word \"photo-graphy\" means \"drawing with light,\" and not \"drawing with Photoshop.\" Taking this to heart, the book celebrates a simple \"get the light right\" approach towards exalting the archetypes of feminine beauty in the over 175 epic portraits.\n\r\n\"Never before have I received so many wonderful shots from a single shoot. And that one portrait is so far my all-time favorite. Let's shoot again soon!\" --Sara, professional model, Los Angeles\n\r\nWhether you are looking to begin capturing epic portraits exalting the beauty of female models, or you have been shooting fashion, lifestyle, and portrait photography for quite some time, this book offers an ideal guide and inspirational mentor! The portrait-packed book is aimed at the wide variety of model, lifestyle, swimsuit, lingerie, boudoir, and fashion photographers, from novices to masters. Across all genres, the basic rules of light remain the same, as do the foundational notions of beauty regarding the classical feminine archetype.\n\r\nFor beginners, the book covers not only the best equipment to purchase, but it also shares the deeper reasons motivating the investment in the particular lenses, cameras, filters, and more. Different scenarios for using a 50mm prime, a 70-200mm zoom, or both, are covered throughout, from tight headshots to more \u201clandscapey\u201d portraits. The beauty of both extreme bokeh and greater \u201cdepths-of-field\u201d are celebrated throughout the varied portraits.\n\r\nFor more advanced photographers who have already chosen their gear and understand the basic technical aspects of model photography, the book also delves into more abstract aspects and philosophies of beauty throughout classical poetry, art, and mythology. Beginner and advanced photographers alike will gain bountiful ideas and inspiration for new poses, props, concepts, lighting, and wardrobe for their future shoots.\n\r\nEach of the over 175 photographs is accompanied by a bit of technical information including the camera and lens used, as well as the f-stop and focal length. And even more importantly, a brief description is offered for each photograph, sharing what the photographer was thinking regarding such aspects of the photograph including some combination of:\n\r\n1. the posing of the model\r\n2. the general composition of the shot\r\n3. the lens choice\r\n4. the type, direction, and quality of light, (and more!)\n\r\nThe basic use of flash, reflectors, and natural light are all covered in a most simple and practical way, in not only words, but photographs.\n\r\nThe book is penned in a rapid, straightforward manner celebrating the visual nature of model photography. It takes the reader on a grand voyage through dozens of photoshoots, so that they might quickly gain the most pertinent knowledge and wisdom from each shoot, so as to apply it in their own future shoots as they follow their vision and exalt their voice in the grand art of photography.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2017", "publisher": "UNKNOWN", "language": "english", "file": "EPUB, 9.03 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/7725000/f36f6a"},

In this series of essays, photographer and teacher Guy Tal shares his thoughts and experiences as an artist who seeks to express more in his images than the mere appearance of the subject portrayed.Tal makes an argument to consider creative landscape photography?expressing something of the photographer's conception through the use of natural aesthetics?as a form of visual art that is distinct from the mere representation of beautiful natural scenes.Tal covers topics such as the art of photography, approaches to landscape photography, and the experiences of a working photographic artist. His essays also include reflections on nature and man\u2019s place in it, living a meaningful life, and living as an artist in today\u2019s world.The book is decidedly non-technical and focuses on philosophy, nature, and visual expression. It was written for those photographers with a passion and interest in creative photography. Anyone who is pursuing their work as art, is in need of inspiration, or is interested in the writings of a full-time working photographic artist will benefit from reading this book.

Blyth", "Peter G. Danias"], "rating": "0", "description": "Throughout his life, Franz Kafka was fascinated by photography, a medium which for him came to encapsulate both the attractions and the pitfalls of modern life. Kafka's personal engagement with the medium - as a keen viewer and collector of photographs as well as an amateur photographer - is reflected in his writings, which explore photography from a variety of different perspectives By far the most frequently and extensively discussed visual medium in Kafka's texts, photography is paradigmatic of his relationship to visuality more generally. This study not only explores photography's recurrence as a theme within his texts but it is also the first to take systematic account of Kafka's use of photographs as literary source material.   Kafka and Photography presents one of the most important modern writers from an entirely new perspective; it sheds new light on familiar works and uncovers unexplored aspects of Kafka's engagement with his time and context. Providing a chronological account of key prose works, as well as the personal writings, this study is accessible to students and lay readers. It will be of interest not only to literary scholars but also to those working in photography, media, and cultural studies. Its detailed textual analyses are set against a richly documented historical context which illustrates Kafka's interest in contemporary culture through a range of visual material taken from public as well as private sources - some of which has only recently become available. As this book demonstrates, photography had a profound impact on Kafka's literary imagination and as such helps to explain the mesmerizing intensity of enigmatic visual detail which is a hallmark of his narratives.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2007", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "295", "ISBN10": "0199219451", "ISBN13": "9780199219452", "file": "PDF, 2.83 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/702442", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/702442/3e5d30"},

Driving is best when you understand how the car works well enough that you can pay attention to the task at hand\u2014 getting to where you want to go. Photography, similarly, should be an activity in which you are not worried about basics. Only when basic camera handling is reflexive can the photographer make the necessary effort to create a great photograph.   When I teach, I try to illustrate lessons with examples of my work.I explain how I tried something that didn\u2019t work, or how I made changes to improve a picture. Showing several possibilities helps the students to understand the options we face as photographers and how important it is to consciously choose between them.As a teacher, I have often found that though students may know how to do something, they don\u2019t understand why to do it. Even worse is when a photographer knows what he or she wants to do, but doesn\u2019t know how to accomplish it. I try to show students many of my photographs and explain how and why I made decisions.

His experience in the industry and as a screenwriting professor and coach have led him to recognize that it's the selection of the initial idea that is the most important part of the process -- with the most impact on the project's chance of success. \n\r\nAnd as Mr. Bork knows from experience, this choice takes a lot more understanding and work to get \"right\" than eager purveyors of the craft tend to realize.\n\r\nMost screenwriters and fiction writers have difficulty getting their work read and accepted by agents, editors and producers mainly because their idea for a story presented in a query or pitch doesn't excite these \"gatekeepers\" like it would need to, for them to want to engage.\n\r\nAnd when they do read the whole story, their core reasons for \"passing\" are usually also about the basic idea (although lack of professional-level execution matters, too). But writers are usually in the dark about this, not realizing that the project they spent months or years on had fundamental flaws on a concept level, in the eyes of the people they most hoped to impress with it.\n\r\nBut even the best fiction writing books and screenwriting experts tend to move quickly past the crucial step of choosing a viable idea, to get to the specific plotting and composition of it, because there is so much to master in those later parts of the process -- which feel a lot more like \"writing\" than developing and mulling over potential story concepts.\n\r\nProfessionals, though, tend to understand the primacy of \"the idea,\" and learn that there are certain key elements in story or series premises that really work, and which are worth investing time and energy in. And that's what The Idea focuses on -- laying out what those specific elements are, and how to master them.\n\r\nWhile its concepts originate from the author's screenwriting experiences, they apply equally to commercial fiction writing, playwriting and other forms of \"story\" -- because the focus is on what makes an underlying concept compelling enough to appeal to a substantial audience or readership.\n\r\nThe \"Seven Elements of a Viable Story\" in The Idea form an acronym for the word PROBLEM, since every story is really about one, at its core:\n\r\nPUNISHING\r\nRELATABLE\r\nORIGINAL\r\nBELIEVABLE\r\nLIFE-ALTERING\r\nENTERTAINING\r\nMEANINGFUL\r\nEach chapter focuses on one of these seven deceptively simple-looking aspects of a strong story, which are anything but easy to master. Mr. Bork highlights his own struggles as a writer, and his arrival at an understanding of how each of these elements works -- and how to know if one's idea really succeeds at each of them. A special section devoted to television writing (and its unique attributes) ends each chapter.\n\r\nWhatever your education and background in writing or story, this book and its unique focus contributes foundationally useful information not covered elsewhere -- which may be the missing piece that leads to greater results, both on the page and in the marketplace.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "20", "edition": "Original retail", "publisher": "Overfall Presss", "language": "english", "pages": "228", "ISBN10": "1732753016", "ISBN13": "9781732753013", "file": "EPUB, 205 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3679629/a663d3"},

David Bordwell argues that the principles of visual storytelling created in the studio era are alive and well, even in today's bloated blockbusters. American filmmakers have created a durable tradition--one that we should not be ashamed to call artistic, and one that survives in both mainstream entertainment and niche-marketed indie cinema. Bordwell traces the continuity of this tradition in a wide array of films made since 1960, from romantic comedies like Jerry Maguire and Love Actually to more imposing efforts like A Beautiful Mind. He also draws upon testimony from writers, directors, and editors who are acutely conscious of employing proven principles of plot and visual style. Within the limits of the \"classical\" approach, innovation can flourish. Bordwell examines how imaginative filmmakers have pushed the premises of the system in films such as JFK, Memento, and Magnolia. He discusses generational, technological, and economic factors leading to stability and change in Hollywood cinema and includes close analyses of selected shots and sequences. As it ranges across four decades, examining classics like American Graffiti and The Godfather as well as recent success like The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, this book provides a vivid and engaging interpretation of how Hollywood moviemakers have created a vigorous, resourceful tradition of cinematic storytelling that continues to engage audiences around the world.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2006", "edition": "1", "language": "english", "pages": "309", "ISBN10": "0520232275", "ISBN13": "9781423755494", "file": "PDF, 1.68 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/965870", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/965870/78231f"},

And, with the advent of digital technology many believe that the so called 'wet chemistry' behind old fashioned photography is a thing of the past - but is it?    The Chemistry of Photography endeavours to unravel the mysteries of picture taking and reflects on the diversity and complexity of the science.  It gives readers an insight into the chemistry needed to generate pictures, spanning all mediums including still and motion picture as well as digital imaging.    Beginning with the components of conventional photography such as films and papers, the book also looks at light capture and amplification, negative films, processing solutions, colour transparencies, the chemistry of colour and motion picture films.  The book concludes with a discussion of digital technology and new innovations in photography.    This fascinating book will appeal to scientists and those with a general interest in both the new and the old science behind photography.", "categories": "Arts - Photography", "year": "2006", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Royal Society of Chemistry", "language": "english", "pages": "242", "ISBN10": "0854042733", "ISBN13": "9780854042739", "file": "PDF, 3.35 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/665958", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/665958/436c9e"},

This initial investigation identifies the dramatic essence of each moment, organizes them into a dramatic unit, and leads to an overall design for rendering the script on the screen. This section includes work with actors, staging, and use of the camera as an active narrator. Students are encouraged to use floor plans and storyboards to aid in the previsualization of the film.Part Two features a scene-by-scene analysis of three feature films by master directors. These are designed to be used in conjunction with the viewing of the films and allows the student to fully understand how the dramatic and narrative categories of film language are used by master directors. In addition, nine other films are analyzed for their distinctive styles and differing dramatic construction.

(volumes I and II) have been classics of film studies for as long as they've been available and are considered the gold standard in the field of film criticism.

He was co-founder of the influential Cahiers du Cin?ma, which under his leadership became one of the world's most distinguished publications. Championing the films of Jean Renoir (who contributed a short foreword to Volume I), Orson Welles, and Roberto Rossellini, he became the prot?g? of Fran?ois Truffaut, who honors him touchingly in his forword to Volume II. This new edition includes graceful forewords to each volume by Bazin scholar and biographer Dudley Andrew, who reconsiders Bazin and his place in contemporary film study.

New technology, new tools and new methods have revolutionized the art and craft of telling stories visually. While some aspects of visual language, lighting and color are eternal, shooting methods, workflow and cameras have changed radically. Even experienced film artists have a need to update and review new methods and equipment. These change affect not only the director of photography but also the director, the camera assistants, gaffers, and digital imaging technicians. Cinematography: Theory and Practice covers both the artistry and craftsmanship of cinematography and visual storytelling. Few art forms are as tied to their tools and technology as is cinematography. Take your mastery of these new tools, techniques, and roles to the next level with this cutting-edge roadmap from author and filmmaker Blain Brown. Whether you are a student of filmmaking, just breaking into the business, currently working in the industry and looking to move up to the next level, or an experienced professional who wants to update their knowledge of tools and techniques, this book provides both a basic introduction to these issues as well as more advanced and in-depth coverage of the subject.

There are an infinite number of ways to represent this beauty. The photographer's role is to create work that is appealing, fitting, and meaningful. This book takes a two-pronged approach: first by teaching the academic and second by encouraging hands-on creativity.\n\r\nThis guide presents the material through five main chapters: Composition, Technique, Posing, Self-Expression (Style), and Shooting Assignments.\n\r\nThe instruction is intended to be accessible to any novice with a serious interest in the composition and posing of female nudes. You do not need to be an artist or a photographer to understand the material but a basic understanding of camera operation is assumed. It is written for the uninitiated and for those who have no more than a modest amount of experience with photography or composition.\n\r\nThe book begins with a discussion of visual literacy and its importance. Next are the abstract elements of composition, such as lines, colors, value, mass, depth, illusion, time, and motion. A section on design principles instructs in the assembly of these elements. Visual pathways, including cyclical, triangular, and others, are explained. Methods of design such as the rule of thirds, the golden mean, diagonal method, armatures, and forty-five degrees are all described and illustrated. The design instruction is rounded out with a discussion of commonalities and pitfalls in the design methods.\n\r\nThe various camera techniques range from controlling framing, focus, and lighting. There is information about high-key, low-key, and minor-key lighting, complete with histograms and diagrams that show where the lights are set up. The section on post-processing mentions the importance of vignettes, contrast, monochrome (black and white) images, color mapping, the zone system, isolating images, and making composites (montages). The book includes 100 examples of nude poses (in addition to the numerous other samples) grouped into sections, such as standing, furniture, and props.\n\r\nThe section on style addresses why we make a photograph and what constitutes an artistic body of work. There is a discussion of how your choice of genre, whether it is pinup, glamour, or fine art, figure study, or commercial design, influences your composition. The examination of style would not be complete without addressing how to analyze your work and sources of inspiration. The shooting assignments are real-world exercises that provide an opportunity to put what you have learned into practice.

Beginning with digital photography techniques and workflow, Skrzypczak draws his own vast experience in wildlife photography to teach about the equipment, the pros and cons of camera types and lenses, and the specific requirements for this demanding task. Also covered are appropriate techniques for exposure for this demanding task. Also covered are appropriate techniques for exposure and autofocus-the latter being one of the major challenges in wildlife photography. He discusses an \"on the road\" workflow, the logistics of transporting your gear, and image editing.  The book goes on to cover the practical aspects of wildlife photography, from shooting animal portraits to panning the camera in order to capture that speeding leopard.

By \r\nfollowing his lessons, you can make any character\u2014person, animal, or \r\nobject\u2014come to life through animated movement!Animation is the process of drawing and photographing a character in successive positions to create lifelike movement. Animators bring life to their drawings, making the viewer believe that the drawings actually think and have feelings. Cartoon Animation was written by an animator\r\n to help you learn how to animate. The pioneers of the art of animation \r\nlearned many lessons, most through trial and error, and it is this body \r\nof knowledge that has established the fundamentals of animation. This book will teach you these fundamentals.\r\n Animators must first know how to draw; good drawing is the cornerstone \r\nof their success. The animation process, however, involves much more \r\nthan just good drawing. This book teaches all the other knowledge and \r\nskills animators must have. In chapter one, Preston Blair shows how to construct original cartoon characters, developing a character\u2019s shape, personality, features, and mannerisms. The second chapter explains how to create movements such as running, walking, dancing, posing, skipping, strutting, and more. Chapter three discusses the finer points of animating a character, including creating key character poses and in-betweens. Chapter four is all about dialogue, how to create realistic mouth and body movements, and facial expressions while the character is speaking. There are helpful diagrams\r\n in this chapter that show mouth positions, along with a thorough \r\nexplanation of how sounds are made using the throat, tongue, teeth, and \r\nlips. Finally, the fifth chapter has clear explanations of a variety of technical topics, including\r\n tinting and spacing patterns, background layout drawings, the cartoon \r\nstoryboard, and the synchronization of camera, background, characters, \r\nsound, and music. Full of expert advice from Preston Blair, as well as helpful drawings and diagrams, Cartoon Animation is a book no animation enthusiast should be without\u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438, \u0432 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439, \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "1994", "publisher": "Walter Foster", "language": "english", "pages": "224 / 202", "ISBN10": "1560100842", "ISBN13": "9781560100843", "file": "PDF, 41.37 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/582627", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/582627/2c03f6"},

Photography is a wonderful and rewarding hobby for millions of people. However, for a photographers work to really stand out, he or she needs two skills: creativity and technical know-how. The former is more difficult to learn and is largely based on talent and experience. The latter is less an art than a craft and can be learned to perfection.   The work that follows the capture of a photographic image - the workflow in the digital darkroom - has a significant effect on the quality of the final image. This workflow is often underestimated and neglected, leading to weak images and poorly managed image collections. The Digital Photography Workflow Handbook will help you avoid crucial mistakes as you master the craft of photographic post-processing.    This book provides a step-by-step guide through the photographic workflow, from image capture, editing, and asset management, all the way to the perfect photographic print. The workflow presented in this book focuses on RAW images, which will give you maximum quality and flexibility, and is based on two of the most popular and powerful software tools: Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.

Visit\u00a0www.luminosoa.org\u00a0to learn more.In this beautifully written and deeply researched study, Hannah Frank provides an original way to understand American animated cartoons from the Golden Age of animation (1920\u20131960). In the pre-digital age of the twentieth century, the making of cartoons was mechanized and standardized: thousands of drawings were inked and painted onto individual transparent celluloid sheets (called \u201ccels\u201d) and then photographed in succession, a labor-intensive process that was divided across scores of artists and technicians. In order to see the art, labor, and technology of cel animation, Frank slows cartoons down to look frame by frame, finding hitherto unseen aspects of the animated image. What emerges is both a methodology and a highly original account of an art formed on the assembly line.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2019", "edition": "Paperback", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "256 / 278", "ISBN10": "0520303628", "ISBN13": "9780520303621", "file": "PDF, 11.21 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/4997393", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/4997393/175174"},

As various Sith Lords emerged and rose to power, they recorded their thoughts, exploits, and plots for Sith control of the galaxy. When they fell, their knowledge vanished with them forever. Or so it seemed. . . .   Over the years, these writings were passed among numerous Sith and Jedi, who added their comments to the pages. In his quest for domination, Darth Sidious tracked down what remained of five pivotal Sith texts written by his most powerful predecessors. Then, drawing on the knowledge within the compiled pages, he wrote a sixth text\u2014his own manifesto. Together, these documents, along with several collected objects associated with them, shed light on the philosophy, achievements, and failures of the Sith Order.   For years, this collection remained hidden, existing as legend only. But now all who are tempted may unlock the Book of Sith and delve into the dark side. . . .

Rooted in the interwar avant-garde and commercial cinema, Chinese revolutionary cinema, as a state cinema for the newly established People's Republic, adapted Chinese literature for the screen, incorporated Hollywood narration, appropriated Soviet montage theory and orchestrated a new, glamorous, socialist star culture. In the wake of decolonisation, Chinese film journals were quick to project and disseminate the country's redefined self-image to Asia, Africa and Latin America as they helped to create an alternative vision of modernity and internationalism. Revealing the historical contingency of the term 'propaganda', Chan uncovers the visual, aural, kinaesthetic, sexual and ideological dynamics that gave rise to a new aesthetic of revolutionary heroism in world cinema.Based on extensive archival research, this book's focus on the distinctive rhetoric of post-war socialist China will be of value to East Asian Cinema scholars, Chinese Studies academics and those interested in the history of twentieth-century socialist culture.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2019", "publisher": "I.B.

Figures Traced in Light is a detailed consideration of how cinematic staging carries the story, expresses emotion, and beguiles the audience through pictorial composition. Ranging over the entire history of cinema, David Bordwell focuses on four filmmakers' unique contributions to the technique. In-depth chapters examine Louis Feuillade, master of the 1910s serial; Kenji Mizoguchi, the great Japanese director who worked from the 1920s to the 1950s; Theo Angelopoulos, who began his career as a political modernist in the late 1960s; and Hou Hsiao-hsien, the Taiwanese filmmaker who in the 1980s became the preeminent Asian director. For comparison, Bordwell draws on films by Howard Hawks, Michelangelo Antonioni, Yasujiro Ozu, Takeshi Kitano, and many other directors. Superbly illustrated with more than 500 frame enlargements and 16 color illustrations, Figures Traced in Light situates its close analysis of model sequences in the context of the technological, industrial, and cultural trends that shaped the directors' approaches to staging.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2005", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "322", "ISBN10": "0520241975", "ISBN13": "9780520241978", "file": "PDF, 44.24 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2517975", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2517975/eccd62"},

In the process, these and other directors of contemporary Japanese horror film consistently contribute exciting and important new visions, from postmodern reworkings of traditional avenging spirit narratives to groundbreaking works of cinematic terror that position depictions of radical or 'monstrous' alterity/hybridity as metaphors for larger socio-political concerns, including shifting gender roles, reconsiderations of the importance of the extended family as a social institution, and reconceptualisations of the very notion of cultural and national boundaries.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2007", "publisher": "Rodopi", "language": "english", "pages": "232", "ISBN10": "9042023317", "ISBN13": "9789042023314", "file": "PDF, 4.67 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/923989", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/923989/8527ec"},

Thomas Lamarre contends that the history, techniques, and complex visual language of animation, particularly Japanese animation, demands serious and sustained engagement, and in The Anime Machine he lays the foundation for a new critical theory for reading Japanese animation, showing how anime fundamentally differs from other visual media.The Anime Machine defines the visual characteristics of anime and the meanings generated by those specifically \"animetic\" effects-the multiplanar image, the distributive field of vision, exploded projection, modulation, and other techniques of character animation-through close analysis of major films and television series, studios, animators, and directors, as well as Japanese theories of animation. Lamarre first addresses the technology of anime: the cells on which the images are drawn, the animation stand at which the animator works, the layers of drawings in a frame, the techniques of drawing and blurring lines, how characters are made to move. He then examines foundational works of anime, including the films and television series of Miyazaki Hayao and Anno Hideaki, the multimedia art of Murakami Takashi, and CLAMP's manga and anime adaptations, to illuminate the profound connections between animators, characters, spectators, and technology. Working at the intersection of the philosophy of technology and the history of thought, Lamarre explores how anime and its related media entail material orientations and demonstrates concretely how the \"animetic machine\" encourages a specific approach to thinking about technology and opens new ways for understanding our place in the technologized world around us.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2009", "language": "english", "pages": "408 / 425", "ISBN10": "081665154X", "ISBN13": "9780816651542", "file": "PDF, 10.20 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/902639", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/902639/d5dcd7"},

But alongside these luminaries stands a lesser-known but equally revered figure, filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky. Robert Bird offers in Andrei Tarkovsky an unprecedented investigation of Tarkovsky\u2019s oeuvre and its far-reaching influence on world cinema.Bird brings a novel approach to his dissection of Tarkovsky\u2019s wholly original techniques and sensibilities, arranging the films into elemental categories of Water, Fire, Earth, and Air. Solaris, Ivan\u2019s Childhood, Mirror, Nostalgia, Andrei Rublev, and Sacrifice all get their due here; through them, Bird explores how the filmmaker probed the elusive correlation between cinematic representation and a more primeval perception of the world. Though the book also considers Tarkovsky\u2019s work in radio, theatre, and opera\u2014as well as his work as an actor, screenwriter, and film theorist\u2014Bird throughout keeps his focus firmly on Tarkovsky as a consummate filmmaker.\u00a0Anchored by a wealth of film stills and photographs, Andrei Tarkovsky is a must-read for all film buffs and admirers of European cinema.

Since Ivan's Childhood won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1962, the visionary quality and totally original and haunting imagery of Tarkovsky's films have captivated serious movie audiences all over the world, who see in his work a continuation of the great literary traditions of nineteenth-century Russia. Many critics have tried to interpret his intensely personal vision, but he himself always remained inaccessible.In Sculpting in Time, Tarkovsky sets down his thoughts and his memories, revealing for the first time the original inspirations for his extraordinary films--Ivan's Childhood, Andrey Rublyov, Solaris, The Mirror, Stalker, Nostalgia, and The Sacrifice. He discusses their history and his methods of work, he explores the many problems of visual creativity, and he sets forth the deeply autobiographical content of part of his oeuvre--most fascinatingly in The Mirror and Nostalgia.

They lay bare what Hollywood under the Production Code attempted to cover up and push offscreen: sexual liaisons unsanctified by the laws of God or man, marriage ridiculed and redefined, ethnic lines crossed and racial barriers ignored, economic injustice exposed and political corruption assumed, vice unpunished and virtue unrewarded -- in sum, pretty much the raw stuff of American culture, unvarnished and unveiled.No other book has yet sought to interpret the films and film-related meanings of the pre-Code era -- what defined the period, why it ended, and what its relationship was to the country as a whole during the darkest years of the Great Depression... and afterward.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "1999", "edition": "First edition, first printing (full number line)", "publisher": "Columbia University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "400 / 447", "ISBN10": "0231110952", "ISBN13": "9780231110952", "file": "PDF, 5.77 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2075003", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2075003/3840e3"},

When first encountering film theory, students are often confronted with a dense, interlocking set of texts full of arcane terminology, inexact formulations, sliding definitions, and abstract generalities. The Routledge Encyclopedia of Film Theory challenges these first impressions by aiming to make film theory accessible and open to new readers.  Edward Branigan and Warren Buckland have commissioned over 50 scholars from around the globe to address the difficult formulations and propositions in each theory by reducing these difficult formulations to straightforward propositions.  The result is a highly accessible volume that clearly defines, and analyzes step by step, many of the fundamental concepts in film theory, ranging from familiar concepts such as \u2018Apparatus\u2019, \u2018Gaze\u2019, \u2018Genre\u2019, and \u2018Identification\u2019, to less well-known and understood, but equally important concepts, such as Alain Badiou\u2019s \u2018Inaesthetics\u2019, Gilles Deleuze\u2019s \u2018Time-Image\u2019, and Jean-Luc Nancy\u2019s \u2018Evidence\u2019.

How can filmmakers working between cultures use cinema, a visual medium, to transmit that physical sense of place and culture? In The Skin of the Film Laura U. Marks offers an answer, building on the theories of Gilles Deleuze and others to explain how and why intercultural cinema represents embodied experience in a postcolonial, transnational world.Much of intercultural cinema, Marks argues, has its origin in silence, in the gaps left by recorded history. Filmmakers seeking to represent their native cultures have had to develop new forms of cinematic expression. Marks offers a theory of \u201chaptic visuality\u201d\u2014a visuality that functions like the sense of touch by triggering physical memories of smell, touch, and taste\u2014to explain the newfound ways in which intercultural cinema engages the viewer bodily to convey cultural experience and memory. Using close to two hundred examples of intercultural film and video, she shows how the image allows viewers to experience cinema as a physical and multisensory embodiment of culture, not just as a visual representation of experience. Finally, this book offers a guide to many hard-to-find works of independent film and video made by Third World diasporic filmmakers now living in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada.The Skin of the Film draws on phenomenology, postcolonial and feminist theory, anthropology, and cognitive science.

We see the visionary, whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen and, when combined with iron determination and obsessive perfectionism, led him to the reinvention of animation. It was Disney, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films\u2014most notably Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi\u2014who transformed animation from a novelty based on movement to an art form that presented an illusion of life.We see him reimagine the amusement park with Disneyland, prompting critics to coin the word Disneyfication to describe the process by which reality can be modified to fit one\u2019s personal desires. At the same time, he provided a new way to connect with American history through his live-action films and purveyed a view of the country so coherent that even today one can speak meaningfully of \u201cWalt Disney\u2019s America.\u201d We see how the True-Life Adventure nature documentaries he produced helped create the environmental movement by sensitizing the general public to issues of conservation. And we see how he reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise in a way that was unprecedented and was later widely imitated.Gabler also reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man, who, despite worldwide success, was plagued with financial problems much of his life, suffered a nervous breakdown, and at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his workshop making model trains. Gabler explores accusations that Disney was a red-baiter, an anti-Semite, an embittered alcoholic.

With the arrival of sound film in the late 1920s, music became part of a complex multimedia text. Although industry, fan-oriented, and scholarly literatures on film music have existed from early on, and music was frequently among the topics discussed and disputed, only in the past thirty years has sustained scholarly attention gone to music in visual media, beginning with the feature film. The Oxford Handbook of Film Music Studies charts that interdisciplinary activity in its primary areas of inquiry: history, genre and medium, analysis and criticism, and interpretation.The handbook provides an overview to the field on a large scale. Chapters in Part I range from the relations of music and the soundtrack to opera and film, textual representation of film sound, and film music as studied by cognitive scientists. Part II addresses genre and medium with chapters focusing on cartoons and animated films, the film musical, music in arcade and early video games, and the interplay of film, music, and recording over the past half century. The chapters in Part III offer case studies in interpretation along with extended critical surveys of theoretical models of gender, sexuality, and subjectivity as they impinge on music and sound. The three chapters on analysis in Part IV are diverse: one systematically models harmonies used in recent films, a second looks at issues of music and film temporality, and a third focuses on television. Chapters on history (Part V) cover topics including musical antecedents in nineteenth-century theater, the complex issues in sychronization of music in performance of early (silent) films, international practices in early film exhibition, and the symphony orchestra in film.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "704 / 696", "ISBN10": "0195328493", "ISBN13": "9780195328493", "file": "PDF, 7.62 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2374396", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2374396/5360da"},

The story is told through interviews with hundreds of actors, directors, law enforcement officials, and other participants, all edited together with expert skill and pacing.\r\nThe industry exploded in the early 1970s with the success of the Mafia-backed Deep Throat, which reportedly grossed $100 million after an initial $22,000 investment. Featured at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973, the film ushered in the rise of \"porno chic,\" making it fashionable, for a time, to take a date to a porn film. One industry insider described Deep Throat as \"the Blair Witch Project of its time.\" Filled with sleazy intrigue, vivid details, and many heartbreaking--and even touching--stories, The Other Hollywood covers the actors, the numerous legal challenges to the industry, FBI sting operations, the Mafia connection, rampant drug use, rock stars, celebrities, the opposition by religious and political groups, the emergence of AIDS (that claimed the lives of porn superstars such as the famously endowed John Holmes), and the explosion of the video market and its overnight fortunes.

''Every Frame a Rembrandt'' is an expression heard on sound stages and locations the world over.  While in most cases the expression is used lightly and not infrequently with a certain amount of sarcasm, its true meaning speaks highly of most cinematographers' commitment to producing the best, most interesting, unusual and memorable images for the screen.  Through the five films he selected for this book Laszlo is able to show the broad range of complexity in motion picture photography, from the relatively simple ''point and shoot'' in the typcal western to complex in-camera effects.  In recounting his ''war stories'' Laszlo is able to show the day to day activities of a cinematographer before, during and after filming the project, discussing equipment, film stocks, testing, labs, unions, agents, budget requirements, and working with the director and producer. The five films discussed are Southern Comfort, The Warriors, Rambo: First Blood, Streets of Fire, and Innerspace.

In what ways can they be seen to have aesthetic, ethical and political value? What do they reveal about experiences of illness, the relationship between the body and identity and the role of the arts in bearing witness to illness for people who are ill and those connected to them? How can they influence medicine, the arts and shape public understandings of health and illness? These questions and more are explored in Illness as Many Narratives, which contains readings of a rich array of representations of illness from the 1980s to the present. A wide range of arts and media are considered such as life writing, photography, performance, film, theatre, artists' books and animation. The individual chapters deploy multidisciplinary critical frameworks and discuss physical and mental illness. Through reading this book you will gain an understanding of the complex contribution illness narratives make to contemporary culture and the emergent field of Critical Medical Humanities.\"", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2016", "publisher": "Edinburgh University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "264", "ISBN10": "1474425585", "ISBN13": "9781474425582", "file": "PDF, 3.89 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5314672", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5314672/841d77"},

Mas alla de la mera critica periodistica, pues, la semiologia aportaba a la reflexion sobre el cine una dimension teorica, algo que hasta entonces habia estado fuera de su alcance. El abordaje de este objeto cine desde la perspectiva del psicoanalisis se inscribe, para Metz, en el mismo campo de investigacion y se situa en identico nivel. No se trata de psicoanalizar a los autores o a sus criaturas, sino de enfrentarse al cine entendido como institucion y arte especifico, como un significante que opera en la region de lo imaginario, tanto con ritos de repeticion como con procedimientos tecnologicos. El significante imaginario, convertido automaticamente en un clasico desde su aparicion en 1977, es en el fondo el doble pseudonimo del cine visto desde una perspectiva freudiana.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2001", "publisher": "Paid\u00f3s", "language": "spanish", "pages": "273 / 136", "ISBN10": "8449311454", "ISBN13": "9788449311451", "file": "PDF, 16.78 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2926280", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2926280/63ee0c"},

When setting up a shot, the camera operator can employ a range of visual techniques that will clearly communicate the idea to an audience. Composition is the bedrock of the operator's craft, yet is seldom taught in training courses in the belief that it is an intuitive, personal skill. Peter Ward shows how composition can be learned, to enhance the quality of your work.    Based on the author's own practical experience, the book deals with the methods available for resolving practical production questions such as:   Does the shot composition accurately reflect the idea that initiated the shot?  Will the content and method of presenting the subject accurately convey the idea?   Major innovations in television and film production since the previous edition have affected the styles of composition, such as wide-screen and the use of mini DV cameras. These new technologies and their implications for picture composition are addressed in this new edition. A new colour plate section is also being included to update the section on colour.   If you are a practising camera operator, trainee camera operator, student or lecturer on a television or film production course, or simply a video enthusiast wishing to progress to a more professional standard you will find this book essential in enhancing the quality of your work.                                         * Learn the secrets of successful composition from an experienced camera operator  * Completely rewritten including compositional implications of widescreen, DV cameras  * Teaches through varied examples of practical scenarios and problem-solving", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2003", "edition": "2nd ed", "publisher": "Focal Press", "language": "english", "pages": "281", "ISBN10": "0240516818", "ISBN13": "9780240516813", "file": "PDF, 9.08 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/699625", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/699625/b750d6"},

At the beginning of the decade,   the industry was still struggling with the transition to talking pictures.   Gangster films and naughty comedies starring Mae West were popular in urban   areas, but aroused threats of censorship in the heartland. Whether the film   business could survive the economic effects of the Crash was up in the air.   By 1939, popularly called \"Hollywood's Greatest Year,\" films like Gone With   the Wind and The Wizard of Oz used both color and sound to spectacular   effect, and remain American icons today. The \"mature oligopoly\" that was   the studio system had not only weathered the Depression and become part of   mainstream culture through the establishment and enforcement of the   Production Code, it was a well-oiled, vertically integrated industrial   powerhouse.  The ten original essays in American Cinema of the 1930s focus on sixty   diverse films of the decade, including Dracula, The Public Enemy, Trouble   in Paradise, 42nd Street, King Kong, Imitation of Life, The Adventures of   Robin Hood, Swing Time, Angels with Dirty Faces, Nothing Sacred, Jezebel,   Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Stagecoach.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2007", "publisher": "Rutgers University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "296", "ISBN10": "0813540828", "ISBN13": "9780813540825", "file": "PDF, 2.70 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/888722", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/888722/3836a8"},

The country fragmented as various challenges   to state power were met with increasing and violent resistance. The Cold   War heated up and the Vietnam War divided Americans. Civil rights, women's   liberation, and gay rights further emerged as significant social issues.   Free love was celebrated even as the decade was marked by assassinations,   mass murders, and social unrest.      At the same time, American cinema underwent radical change as well.   The studio system crumbled, and the Production Code was replaced by a new   ratings system. Among the challenges faced by the film industry was the   dawning shift in theatrical exhibition from urban centers to surburban   multiplexes, an increase in runaway productions, the rise of independent   producers, and competition from both television and foreign art films.   Hollywood movies became more cynical, violent, and sexually explicit,   reflecting the changing values of the time.    In ten original essays, American Cinema of the 1960s examines a range   of films that characterized the decade, including Hollywood movies,   documentaries, and independent and experimental films.  Among the films   discussed are Elmer Gantry, The Apartment, West Side Story, The Manchurian   Candidate, To Kill a Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Bonnie and Clyde, 2001: A   Space Odyssey, Midnight Cowbody, and Easy Rider.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2008", "publisher": "Rutgers University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "296 / 297", "ISBN10": "0813542189", "ISBN13": "9780813544717", "file": "PDF, 2.86 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/813600", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/813600/b7b63b"},

Who is actually doing the philosophizing? Is it the philosophical commentator who reads general arguments or theories into the stories conveyed by a film? Could it be the film-maker, or a group of collaborating film-makers, who raise and try to answer philosophical questions with a film? Is there something about the experience of films that is especially suited to the stimulation of worthwhile philosophical reflections? In the first part of this book, Paisley Livingston surveys positions and arguments surrounding the cinema's philosophical value. He raises criticisms of bold theses in this area and defends a moderate view of film's possible contributions to philosophy. In the second part of the book he defends an intentionalist approach that focuses on the film-makers' philosophical background assumptions, sources, and aims. Livingston outlines intentionalist interpretative principles as well as an account of authorship in cinema. The third part of the book exemplifies this intentionalist approach with reference to the work of Ingmar Bergman. Livingston explores the connection between Bergman's work and the Swedish director's primary philosophical source-a treatise in philosophical psychology authored by the Finnish philosopher, Eino Kaila. Bergman proclaimed that reading this book was a tremendous philosophical experience for him and that he \"built on this ground.\" With reference to materials in the newly created Ingmar Bergman archive, Livingston shows how Bergman took up Kaila's topics in his cinematic explorations of motivated irrationality, inauthenticity, and the problem of self-knowledge.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2009", "language": "english", "pages": "224 / 226", "ISBN10": "0199570175", "ISBN13": "9780199570171", "file": "PDF, 2.90 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/998939", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/998939/030fae"},

Lee is shown to be a major 'event' in both global film and global popular culture - a figure who's central to many intercultural encounters, texts, and practices. Many key elements of film and cultural theory are employed to theorize Bruce Lee, and Lee is shown to be a complex - and consequential - multimedia, multidisciplinary and multicultural phenomenon. Theorizing Bruce Lee is essential reading for anyone interested in Bruce Lee in popular culture and as an object of academic study.    \"Bruce Lee is a complex and contradictory figure, and it's a formidable task to take on the multiple facets of his legacy - fighter, film star, philosopher, nationalist, multiculturalist, innovator.  With an approach as multidisciplinary and iconoclastic as Lee's approach to martial arts, Bowman provides an original and exhilarating account of Lee as 'cultural event'.  No one has done a better job of explaining why the martial arts 'legend' remains such an important and provocative figure.\"  -Leon Hunt (Brunel University), author of Kung Fu Cult Masters: From Bruce Lee to Crouching Tiger.  -  \"Taking on Martin Heidegger and Slavoj ?i?ek as well as drawing on Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Guy Debord, Jacques Ranci?re, Rey Chow, and Stuart Hall, among others, Bowman shows how Bruce Lee 'speaks' to the philosophical debates that frame our understanding of global popular culture today.  Although Bowman may not be able to resolve the philosophical battles surrounding our ability to 'know' Bruce Lee, he does a remarkable job of articulating why Bruce Lee remains an essential force within not only world cinema but global culture - both 'high' and 'low.'  Armoured with his philosophical nunchakus, Bowman goes to battle with anyone who may doubt Lee's ongoing importance, and this book will undoubtedly become essential reading for everyone (from philosopher to kung fu practitioner) interested in popular culture and Asian cinema.\"   - Gina Marchetti (University of Hong Kong), author of Romance and the \"Yellow Peril\": Race, Sex and Discursive Strategies in Hollywood Fiction, and From Tian'anmen to Times Square: Transnational China and the Chinese Diaspora on Global Screens, 1989-1997.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2009", "language": "english", "pages": "260", "ISBN10": "9042027770", "ISBN13": "9789042027770", "file": "PDF, 1.78 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/841121", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/841121/00a7fd"},

For seven seasons, Mad Men asked viewers to contemplate the 1960s anew, reassessing the tumultuous era's stance on women's rights, race, war, politics, and family relationships that comprise the American Dream. Set in the heart of the twentieth century, the show brought to light how deeply we still are connected to that age. The result is a show that continually asks us to rethink our own families, lives, work, and ethical beliefs as we strive for a better world. In Mad Men: A Cultural History, M. Keith Booker and Bob Batchelor offer an engaging analysis of the series, providing in-depth examinations of its many themes and nostalgic portrayals of the years from Camelot to Vietnam and beyond. Highly regarded cultural scholars and critics, Booker and Batchelor examine the show in its entirety, presenting readers with a deep but accessible exploration of the series, as well as look at its larger meanings and implications. This cultural history perspective reveals Mad Men's critical importance as a TV series, as well as its role as a tool for helping viewers understand how they are shaped by history and culture. As a showcase in America's new \"golden age of television,\" Mad Men reveals the deep hold history and nostalgia have on viewers, particularly when combined with stunning visuals and intricate writing and storylines. With this volume as their guide, readers will enjoy contemplating the show's place among the most lauded popular culture touchstones of the twenty-first century. As it engages with ideas central to the American experience--from the evolution of gender roles to family dynamics and workplace relationships--Mad Men: A Cultural History brings to life the significance of this profound yet entertaining series.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2016", "publisher": "Rowman & Littlefield", "language": "english", "pages": "314", "ISBN10": "1442261455", "ISBN13": "9781442261457", "file": "EPUB, 6.47 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5266664/45f010"},

This volume considers her production as a whole, revisiting overlooked films like  Mur, Murs/Documenteur (1980--81), and connecting her cinema to recent installation work. This study demonstrates how Varda has resisted norms of representation and diktats of production. It also shows how she has elaborated a personal repertoire of images, characters, and settings, which all provide insight on their cultural and political contexts. The book thus offers new readings of this director's multifaceted r\u00eaveries, arguing that her work should be seen as an aesthetically influential and ethically-driven production where cinema is both a political and collaborative practice, and a synesthetic art form.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2014", "publisher": "Wallflower Press", "language": "english", "pages": "208 / 169", "ISBN10": "0231169752", "ISBN13": "9780231169752", "file": "PDF, 3.05 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2341046", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2341046/2799b0"},

From the battling robots that define the mecha genre through to Studio Ghibli's dominant genre-brand of plucky shojo (young girl) characters, this book charts the rise of anime as a globally significant category of animation. It further thinks through the differences between anime's local and global genres: from the less-considered niches like nichijo-kei (everyday style anime) through to the global popularity of science fiction anime, this book tackles the tensions between the markets and audiences for anime texts. Anime is consequently understood in this book as a complex cultural phenomenon: not simply a \u201cgenre,\u201d but as an always shifting and changing set of texts. Its inherent changeability makes anime an ideal contender for global dissemination, as it can be easily re-edited, translated and then newly understood as it moves through the world's animation markets. As such, Anime: A Critical Introduction explores anime through a range of debates that have emerged around its key film texts, through discussions of animation and violence, through debates about the cyborg and through the differences between local and global understandings of anime products. Anime: A Critical Introduction uses these debates to frame a different kind of understanding of anime, one rooted in contexts, rather than just texts. In this way, Anime: A Critical Introduction works to create a space in which we can rethink the meanings of anime as it travels around the world.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2015", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Bloomsbury Academic", "language": "english", "pages": "201 / 743", "ISBN13": "9781472576811", "file": "PDF, 2.68 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/5558642", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/5558642/940361"},

During the interwar period, the signs of modernity were ubiquitous in Japan's urban architecture, literature, fashion, advertising, popular music, and cinema. The reconstruction of Tokyo following the disastrous earthquake of 1923 highlighted the extent of this cultural transformation, and the film industry embraced the reconfigured space as an expression of the modern. Shochiku Kamata Film Studios (1920-1936), the focus of this study, was the only studio that continued filmmaking in Tokyo following the city's complete destruction. Mitsuyo Wada-Marciano points to the influence of the new urban culture in Shochiku's interwar films, acclaimed as  modan na eiga , or modern films, by and for Japanese.   Wada-Marciano's thought-provoking examinations illustrate the reciprocal relationship between cinema and Japan's vernacular modernity--what Japanese modernity actually meant to Japanese. Neither a belated imitation of Western modernity nor an isolated cultural invention, Japanese modernity began as a series of negotiations of cultural influences constructed out of local needs. During the interwar period, Japan's film industry began to compete with Western cinemas, producing and distributing its own films and negotiating its place in the Japanese market. It managed to shift the locus of dominance away from Hollywood films by addressing the new classes of labor with self-reflexive subjects and narratives. Film images of salaried men, modern girls, college students, and nuclear families made possible the sudden arrival and rapid proliferation of the modern consumer subject in Japan.   By searching out connections between history and film texts, Wada-Marciano offers a new approach to understanding Japan's national cinema. Her thorough and thoughtful analyses of dozens of films within the cultural contexts of Japan contribute to the current inquiry into non-Western vernacular modernities.  Nippon Modern  will appeal to a wide range of readers in diverse disciplines, including intellectual history, gender studies, and literature, in addition to film/visual studies and Japanese cultural studies.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2008", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University of Hawaii Press", "language": "english", "pages": "201", "ISBN10": "0824831829", "ISBN13": "9780824831820", "file": "PDF, 3.57 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/808414", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/808414/543690"},

Rashomon helped ignite Western interest in the Japanese cinema, and Seven Samurai and Yojimbo remain enormously popular both in Japan and abroad. Providing a new and comprehensive look at this master filmmaker, The Warrior's Camera probes the complex visual structure of Kurosawa's work. The book shows how Kurosawa attempted to symbolize on film a course of national development for post-war Japan, and it traces the ways that he tied his social visions to a dynamic system of visual and narrative forms. The author analyzes Kurosawa's entire career and places the films in context by drawing on the director's autobiography--a fascinating work that presents Kurosawa as a Kurosawa character and the story of his life as the kind of spiritual odyssey witnessed so often in his films. After examining the development of Kurosawa's visual style in his early work, The Warrior's Camera explains how he used this style in subsequent films to forge a politically committed model of filmmaking. It then demonstrates how the collapse of Kurosawa's efforts to participate as a filmmaker in the tasks of social reconstruction led to the very different cinematic style evident in his most recent films, works of pessimism that view the world as resistant to change.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "1992", "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "366", "ISBN10": "0691031606", "ISBN13": "9780691031606", "file": "PDF, 10.04 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1215165", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1215165/392431"},

Beginning with Rossellini's work within the fascist cinema, it discusses his invention of neorealism, a new cinematic style that resulted in several classics during the immediate postwar period. Almost immediately, however, Rossellini's continually evolving style moved beyond mere social realism to reveal other aspects of the camera's gaze, as is apparent in the films he made with Ingrid Bergman during the 1950s; though unpopular, these works had a tremendous impact on the French New Wave critics and directors.  Rossellini's late career marks a return to his nonrealist period, now critically reexamined, in such works as the commercially successful General della Rovere, and his eventual turn to the creation of didactic films for television.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "1993", "language": "english", "pages": "200", "ISBN10": "0521392365", "ISBN13": "9780521392365", "file": "PDF, 30.90 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/829973", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/829973/e63ca2"},

A Hollywood celebrity, Ford lived his life against the background that Twentieth Century-Fox fashioned for him. As he did, the facts of his life merged with\u2014and became inseparable from\u2014his multifaceted legend, fostered by Hollywood\u2019s studio culture and his own imagination.In The Westerns and War Films of John Ford Sue Matheson offers an engaging look at one of America\u2019s greatest directors and the two genres of films that solidified his reputation.Drawing on previously unreleased material, this volume explores the man, the filmmaker, the veteran, and the legend\u2014and the ways in which all of those roles shaped Ford\u2019s view of America, national character, and his creative output. Among the films discussed here in depth are Ford\u2019s early productions, such as The Iron Horse and Drums along the Mohawk, his military films, such as Submarine Patrol, The Battle of Midway, and They Were Expendable, and his Westerns, including Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, The Searchers, and Cheyenne Autumn. Ford imbued many of his creations with a point of view that represented his ideals, and the films discussed here illustrate their director\u2019s distinct vision of American life on the frontier and in service of the country. That vision\u2014Ford\u2019s idealization of the American Character\u2014would, in turn, shape the worldview of several generations.

Screening the Past engages with current debates about the role of cinema in mediating history through memory and nostalgia, suggesting that many films use strategies of memory to produce diverse forms of knowledge which challenge established ideas of history, and the traditional role of historians.   Classic essays sit side by side with new research, contextualized by introductions which bring them up to date, and provide suggestions for further reading as the work of contemporary directors such as Martin Scorsese, Kathryn Bigelow, Todd Haynes and Wong Kar-wai is used to examine the different ways they deploy creative processes of memory.  Pam Cook also investigates the recent history of film studies, reviewing the developments that have culminated in the exciting, if daunting, present moment. The result is a rich and stimulating volume that will appeal to anyone with an interest in cinema, memory and identity.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2004", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Routledge", "language": "english", "pages": "264 / 222", "ISBN10": "0415183758", "ISBN13": "9780415183758", "file": "PDF, 4.80 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1014242", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1014242/41e349"},

With its classic elements of gunfights, gambling, heroes, sidekicks, love, and death, the genre is now perceived by critics as an intriguing object of study.\r\nThis book analyzes the construction of the stories presented in spaghetti westerns. It examines the content of the Italian western using concepts and constructs borrowed from scholars studying \"pre-industrial\" narratives. Plot, the constellation of characters, their relationship to each other, and their motives are studied. Films examined in detail include the seminal A Fistful of Dollars as well as Django, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. There is also a discussion of the early spaghetti westerns. The study then probes the elements of bounty hunters, the deprived hero, partnerships, betrayal, and comedy.

Phillips", "Charles F. Gritzner", "James Bamford"], "rating": "0", "description": "Cinema is not only a major industry in India, it is a powerful cultural force. But until now, no one has undertaken a major examination of the ways in which films made in Bombay mediate the urban experience in India. In  Bombay Cinema , Ranjani Mazumdar takes a multidisciplinary approach to understanding Bombay cinema as the unofficial archive of the city in India.    In this analysis of the cinematic city, Mazumdar reveals a complex postnationalist world, convulsed by the social crisis of the 1970s and transformed by the experience of globalization in the 1990s. She argues that the upheaval of postcolonial nationalism led to Bombay cinema\u2019s articulation of urban life in entirely new terms. Specifically, the place of the village in the imaginary constitution of anticolonial nationalism gave way to a greater acknowledgment, even centrality, of urban space.  Bombay Cinema  takes the reader on an inventive journey through a cinematic city of mass crowds, violence, fashion, architectural fantasies, and subcultural identities. Moving through the world of gangsters and vamps, families and drifters, and heroes and villains,  Bombay Cinema  explores an urban landscape marked by industrial decline, civic crisis, working-class disenchantment, and diverse street life.Combining the anecdotal with the theoretical, the philosophical with the political, and the textual with the historical,  Bombay Cinema  leads the reader into the heart of the urban labyrinth in India, revising and deepening our understanding of both the city and the cinema.    \"A landmark study\u2014carefully researched, well organized and offering refreshingly uncondescending and strikingly insightful discussions of mainstream films\u2014that deserves to be read by anyone interested in India's popular cinema or its contemporary urban life.\" \u2014 Journal of Asian Studies     \" Bombay Cinema  is an exciting and important contribution to a field that has, to date, been under researched and under theorized. Lively, provocative and richly suggestive, it will also serve as a surefire incentive to watch those films all over again.\" \u2014 Screen     \"Here, at last, is a book length study on Cinema in India that does not get locked into a dance of hermetic closure between what transpires on screen and a set of stock off screen textual and cultural references, but more importantly, walks the streets where the films are set, looks at shop windows, publicity material, costumes, fashion, architecture, telecommunications and the concrete materiality that surrounds the film object.\" \u2014 Seminar     \" Bombay Cinema  is lucid, provocative, stylish and substantial. It is an illuminating scholarly study that spares no effort to bring Bombay cinema out of the academic closet.\" \u2014 The Book Review India     \"Departing from the obsession that Film Studies in India has displayed with the idea of cinema as a national allegory, the book convincingly argues for the need to examine the city's hidden archive as one that cannot be subsumed within the sign of the national.\" \u2014 Biblio     \"Mazumdar has a great capacity to discuss Indian cinema, with a brilliant grasp of its political, historical, and aesthetic developments, but equally she is well attuned to the interests and ruptures in the academic discourse of film and cinema studies.\"\u2014 Film International     \"Mazumdar's experience as a filmmaker allowed her to offer significant readings of not just the narratives and character development in the films, but of the cinematography, mise-en-scene, and other technical and performance aspects of production.\" \u2014 Journal of Popular Culture     \"At once about Hindi films, spatial practices, urban modernity and globalization . . . the strength of  Bombay Cinema  lies in bringing all of them together in a productive conversation.\u201d \u2014 Economic and Political Weekly", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Univ Of Minnesota Press", "language": "english", "pages": "298", "ISBN10": "0816649413", "ISBN13": "9780816649419", "file": "PDF, 3.55 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/768598", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/768598/5b1ccd"},

And during Weimar Germany's advance to technological modernity, light - particularly the representational possibilities of electrical light - became the link between the cinema screen and the rapid changes that were transforming German life.  In Frances Guerin's compelling history of German silent cinema of the 1920s, the innovative use of light is the pivot around which a new conception of a national cinema, and a national culture emerges.  Guerin depicts a nocturnal Germany suffused with light - electric billboards, storefronts, police searchlights - and shows how this element of the mise-en-scene came to reflect both the opportunities and the anxieties surrounding modernity and democracy.  Guerin's interpretations center on use of light in films such as Schatten (1923), Variete (1925), Metropolis (1926), and Der Golem (1920).  In these films we see how light is the substance of image composition, the structuring device of the narrative, and the central thematic concern.    This history relieves German films of the responsibility to explain the political and ideological instability of the period, an instability said to be the uncertain foundation of Nazism.

Guided by a personal canon of great films, Rosenbaum sees, in the ongoing hostility toward the idea of a canon shared by many within the field of film studies, a missed opportunity both to shape the discussion about cinema and to help inform and guide casual and serious filmgoers alike.In  Essential Cinema, Rosenbaum forcefully argues that canons of great films are more necessary than ever, given that film culture today is dominated by advertising executives, sixty-second film reviewers, and other players in the Hollywood publicity machine who champion mediocre films at the expense of genuinely imaginative and challenging works. He proposes specific definitions of excellence in film art through the creation a personal canon of both well-known and obscure movies from around the world and suggests ways in which other canons might be similarly constructed. Essential Cinema offers in-depth assessments of an astonishing range of films: established classics such as  Rear Window,  M, and  Greed; ambitious but flawed works like  The Thin Red Line and  Breaking the Waves; eccentric masterpieces from around the world, including  Irma Vep and  Archangel; and recent films that have bitterly divided critics and viewers, among them  Eyes Wide Shut and  A.I. He also explores the careers of such diverse filmmakers as Robert Altman, Ra\u00fal Ruiz, Frank Tashlin, Elaine May, Sam Fuller, Terrence Davies, Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Orson Welles. In conclusion, Rosenbaum offers his own film canon of 1,000 key works from the beginning of cinema to the present day. A cogent and provocative argument about the art of film,  Essential Cinema is also a fiercely independent reference book of must-see movies for film lovers everywhere.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2004", "publisher": "Johns Hopkins University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "472 / 468", "ISBN10": "0801878403", "ISBN13": "9780801878404", "file": "PDF, 2.05 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2474228", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2474228/2297be"},

As the cinema began to separate itself from the commercial entertainments in whose context films initially had been shown--vaudeville, dime museums, fairgrounds--a particular concept of its spectator was developed on the level of film style, as a means of predicting the reception of films on a mass scale. In Babel and Babylon Miriam Hansen offers an original perspective on American film by tying the emergence of spectatorship to the historical transformation of the public sphere.  Hansen builds a critical framework for understanding the cultural formation of spectatorship, drawing on the Frankfurt School's debates on mass culture and the public sphere. Focusing on exemplary moments in the American silent era, she explains how the concept of the spectator evolved as a crucial part of the classical Hollywood paradigm--as one of the new industry's strategies to integrate ethnically, socially, and sexually differentiated audiences into a modern culture of consumption. In this process, Hansen argues, the cinema might also have provided the conditions of an alternative public sphere for particular social groups, such as recent immigrants and women, by furnishing an intersubjective context in which they could recognize fragments of their own experience.    After tracing the emergence of spectatorship as an institution, Hansen pursues the question of reception through detailed readings of a single film, D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916), and of the cult surrounding a single star, Rudolph Valentino. In each case the classical construction of spectatorship is complicated by factors of gender and sexuality, crystallizing around the fear and desire of the female consumer.    Babel and Babylon recasts the debate on early American cinema--and by implication on American film as a whole. It is a model study in the field of Cinema Studies, mediating the concerns of recent film theory with those of recent film history.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "1991", "publisher": "Harvard University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "390", "ISBN10": "0674058313", "ISBN13": "9780674058309", "file": "PDF, 18.24 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/892729", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/892729/d6f983"},

Griffith's  The Birth of a Nation --all became objects of public concern after 1906, when the proliferation of nickelodeons brought moving pictures to a broad mass public. Lee Grieveson draws on extensive original research to examine the controversies over these films and over cinema more generally. He situates these contestations in the context of regulatory concerns about populations and governance in an early-twentieth-century America grappling with the powerful forces of modernity, in particular, immigration, class formation and conflict, and changing gender roles. Tracing the discourses and practices of cultural and political elites and the responses of the nascent film industry, Grieveson reveals how these interactions had profound effects on the shaping of film content, form, and, more fundamentally, the proposed social function of cinema: how cinema should function in society, the uses to which it might be put, and thus what it could or would be.  Policing Cinema  develops new perspectives for the understanding of censorship and regulation and the complex relations between governance and culture.

How their personal experiences of exile or diaspora translate into cinema is a key focus of Naficy's work. Although the experience of expatriation varies greatly from one person to the next, the films themselves exhibit stylistic similarities, from their open- and closed-form aesthetics to their nostalgic and memory-driven multilingual narratives, and from their emphasis on political agency to their concern with identity and transgression of identity. The author explores such features while considering the specific histories of individuals and groups that engender divergent experiences, institutions, and modes of cultural production and consumption. Treating creativity as a social practice, he demonstrates that the films are in dialogue not only with the home and host societies but also with audiences, many of whom are also situated astride cultures and whose desires and fears the filmmakers wish to express. Comparing these films to Hollywood films, Naficy calls them \"accented.\" Their accent results from the displacement of the filmmakers, their alternative production modes, and their style. Accented cinema is an emerging genre, one that requires new sets of viewing skills on the part of audiences. Its significance continues to grow in terms of output, stylistic variety, cultural diversity, and social impact.

Goodman"], "rating": "0", "description": "Jon Lewis weaves a compelling narrative of how box office needs--rather than moral strictures--have dictated the history of film regulation. Telling the complex and fascinating story of how Hollywood abandoned the Production Code and developed the ratings system, and then telling the even more compelling story of how the X rating became a desirable marketing device when hard-core pornography became popular,Hollywood v. Hard Core reveals a great deal about the true business of censorship.   --Linda Williams, Author of Hard Core : Power, Pleasure, and the ''Frenzy of the Visible''    In 1972, The Godfather and Deep Throat were the two most popular films in the country. One, a major Hollywood studio production, the other an independently made ''skin flick.'' At that moment, Jon Lewis asserts, the fate of the American film industry hung in the balance.    Spanning the 20th century, Hollywood v. Hard Core  weaves a gripping tale of censorship and regulation. Since the industry's infancy, film producers and distributors have publicly regarded ratings codes as a necessary evil. Hollywood regulates itself, we have been told, to prevent the government from doing it for them. But Lewis argues that the studios self-regulate because they are convinced it is good for business, and that censorship codes and regulations are a crucial part of what binds the various competing agencies in the film business together.    Yet between 1968 and 1973 Hollywood films were faltering at the box office, and the major studios were in deep trouble. Hollywood's principal competition came from a body of independently produced and distributed films--from foreign art house film Last Tango in Paris to hard-core pornography like Behind the Green Door--that were at once disreputable and, for a moment at least, irresistible, even chic. In response, Hollywood imposed the industry-wide MPAA film rating system (the origins of the G, PG, and R designations we have today) that pushed sexually explicit films outside the mainstream, and a series of Supreme Court decisions all but outlawed the theatrical exhibition of hard core pornographic films. Together, these events allowed Hollywood to consolidate its iron grip over what films got made and where they were shown, thus saving it from financial ruin.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2000", "publisher": "NYU Press", "language": "english", "pages": "391", "ISBN10": "0814751423", "ISBN13": "9780585479798", "file": "PDF, 1.45 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/695169", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/695169/80c9c2"},

They argue for the abandonment of \"national cinema\" as an analytic tool and propose \"cinema and the national\" as a more productive framework. With this approach, they show how movies from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Chinese diaspora construct and contest different ideas of Chinese nation -- as empire, republic, or ethnicity, and complicated by gender, class, style, transnationalism, and more. Among the issues and themes covered are the tension between operatic and realist modes, male and female star images, transnational production and circulation of Chinese films, the image of the good foreigner -- all related to different ways of imagining nation.

Besserer", "Heinz Hermann Koelle (ed.)"], "rating": "0", "description": "One of the most prolific and respected directors of Japanese cinema, Naruse Mikio (1905\u201369) made eighty-nine films between 1930 and 1967. Little, however, has been written about Naruse in English, and much of the writing about him in Japanese has not been translated into English. With The Cinema of Naruse Mikio, Catherine Russell brings deserved critical attention to this under-appreciated director. Besides illuminating Naruse\u2019s contributions to Japanese and world cinema, Russell\u2019s in-depth study of the director sheds new light on the Japanese film industry between the 1930s and the 1960s.\r\nNaruse was a studio-based director, a company man renowned for bringing films in on budget and on time. During his long career, he directed movies in different styles of melodrama while displaying a remarkable continuity of tone. His films were based on a variety of Japanese literary sources and original scripts; almost all of them were set in contemporary Japan. Many were \u201cwomen\u2019s films.\u201d They had female protagonists, and they depicted women\u2019s passions, disappointments, routines, and living conditions. While neither Naruse or his audiences identified themselves as \u201cfeminist,\u201d his films repeatedly foreground, if not challenge, the rigid gender norms of Japanese society. Given the complex historical and critical issues surrounding Naruse\u2019s cinema, a comprehensive study of the director demands an innovative and interdisciplinary approach. Russell draws on the critical reception of Naruse in Japan in addition to the cultural theories of Harry Harootunian, Miriam Hansen, and Walter Benjamin. She shows that Naruse\u2019s movies were key texts of Japanese modernity, both in the ways that they portrayed the changing roles of Japanese women in the public sphere and in their depiction of an urban, industrialized, mass-media-saturated society.\n\r\nAbout The Author(s)\r\nCatherine Russell is Professor of Film Studies at Concordia University.

From the earliest flickering images of the Lumiere brothers in the late 19th century and throughout the years that followed, France has sometimes preceded and often paralleled the technical and artistic developments in cinema occuring internationally.

Focusing on the personalities that have created and formed an international art form, Lanzoni concentrates on directors and stars, bringing new insights into the work of Robert Bresson, Jean Cocteau, Jean Renoir, Francois Truffaut, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Yves Montand and Jeanne Moreau among others.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2002", "publisher": "Continuum International Publishing Group", "language": "english", "pages": "498 / 496", "ISBN10": "0826413994", "ISBN13": "9780826413994", "file": "PDF, 28.62 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2207708", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2207708/e069f6"},

On Cinema brings together for the first time in the English language a comprehensive selection of Rocha's film writings, revealing for the first time to English-speaking readers the full critical power, inventiveness and vision of a great filmmaker. Rocha's writings, endowed with critical verve and humour, give insights into key moments of film history, as well as the politics of world cinema. Here he fearlessly confronts the film establishment and debates with a host of sacred filmmakers of the world pantheon. Included is Rocha's early criticism of Brazilian films, landmark manifestoes such as 'An Aesthetics of Hunger' and 'An Aesthetics of Dreams', articles about the development of Cinema Novo, and his international film criticism, including pieces on Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, James Dean, David Lean, John Huston, Stanley Kubrick, John Ford, Jean-Luc Godard, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Federico Fellini, Luis Bunuel, Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini.

Pennington", "Mario Lurig"], "rating": "0", "description": "Today the world's media have a pressing need to understand and   interpret the modern Middle East. In this timely book, Lina Khatib examines   how contemporary American cinema and the cinemas of the Arab world   contribute to this global preoccupation in their representations of Middle   Eastern politics. This examination of Hollywood as the dominant Western   interpreter of the Arab World also views the Arab world in terms of how it   perceives itself and others through its films. It covers films made in the   USA, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine over   the final two decades of the last century and into the present, showing how   these cinemas represent major political issues in the Middle East, from the   Arab-Israeli conflict, through the Gulf War, to Islamic fundamentalism. It   also uncovers the challenges presented by Arab cinemas to Hollywood's ways   of representing Middle East politics. The book goes beyond an analysis of   difference, to address similarities in how political themes are selected as   well as in the cinematic language that gives them life. For example, it   looks at cinema as a tool of nationalism in the USA and the Arab world and   at how the representations of political issues by Hollywood and Arab   cinemas are informed by the political and historical contexts in which they   occur. This book is inspired by Edward Said's writing on Orientalism, but   it goes further, to show not only how the 'Orient' is constructed by the   'Occident', but also how the 'Orient' itself is consumed by power struggles   both internal and external. \"Filming The Modern Middle East\" therefore   establishes an important link between discourses of the West and those of   the East.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2006", "publisher": "I.

New technology, new tools and new methods have revolutionized the art and craft of telling stories visually. While some aspects of visual language, lighting and color are eternal, shooting methods, workflow and cameras have changed radically. Even experienced film artists have a need to update and review new methods and equipment. These change affect not only the director of photography but also the director, the camera assistants, gaffers, and digital imaging technicians. Cinematography: Theory and Practice covers both the artistry and craftsmanship of cinematography and visual storytelling. Few art forms are as tied to their tools and technology as is cinematography. Take your mastery of these new tools, techniques, and roles to the next level with this cutting-edge roadmap from author and filmmaker Blain Brown. Whether you are a student of filmmaking, just breaking into the business, currently working in the industry and looking to move up to the next level, or an experienced professional who wants to update their knowledge of tools and techniques, this book provides both a basic introduction to these issues as well as more advanced and in-depth coverage of the subject.

American Cinema of the 1970s, however, looks beyond the strobe lights to reveal how profoundly the seventies have influenced American life and how the films of that decade represent a peak moment in cinema history. Far from a placid era, the seventies was a decade of social upheavals. Events such as the killing of students at Kent State and Jackson State universities, the Watergate investigations, the legalization of abortion, and the end of the American involvement in Vietnam are only a few among the many landmark occurrences that challenged the foundations of American culture. The director-driven movies of this era reflect this turmoil, experimenting with narrative structures, offering a gallery of scruffy antiheroes, and revising traditional genre conventions. Bringing together ten original essays, American Cinema of the 1970s examines the range of films that marked the decade, including Jaws, Rocky, Love Story, Shaft, Dirty Harry, The Godfather, Deliverance, The Exorcist, Shampoo, Taxi Driver, Star Wars, Saturday Night Fever, Kramer vs. Kramer, and Apocalypse Now. Lester D. Friedman is the Senior Scholar-in-Residence in the Media and Society Program at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and the author of numerous books on film. uploading 0", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2007", "publisher": "Rutgers University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "249 / 301", "ISBN10": "0813540232", "ISBN13": "9780813540238", "file": "PDF, 2.33 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/754271", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/754271/34a5dc"},

So it is no surprise that filmmakers around the globe explore the experiences of growing up in their work. From blockbuster U.S. movies such as the Harry Potter series to thought-provoking foreign films such as Bend It Like Beckham and Whale Rider, films about youth delve into young people's attitudes, styles, sexuality, race, families, cultures, class, psychology, and ideas. These cinematic representations of youth also reflect perceptions about youth in their respective cultures, as well as young people's worth to the larger society. Indeed, as the contributors to this volume make plain, films about young people open a very revealing window on the attitudes and values of cultures across the globe.   Youth Culture in Global Cinema offers the first comprehensive investigation of how young people are portrayed in film around the world. Eighteen established film scholars from eleven different national backgrounds discuss a wide range of films that illuminate the varied conditions in which youth live. The essays are grouped thematically around the issues of youthful resistance and rebellion; cultural and national identity, including religion and politics; and sexual maturation, including gender distinctions and coming-of-age queer. Some essays engage in close readings of films, while others examine the advertising and reception of films or investigate psychological issues. The volume concludes with filmographies of over 700 youth-related titles arranged by nation and theme.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2007", "edition": "1st ed", "publisher": "University of Texas Press", "language": "english", "pages": "364", "ISBN10": "0292714149", "ISBN13": "9780292709300", "file": "PDF, 8.39 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/678431", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/678431/b95a3b"},

Ten years in the making, Kenji Mizoguchi and the Art of Japanese Cinema is the definitive guide to the life and work of one of the greatest film-makers of the 20th century.Born at the end of the 19th Century into a wealthy family, Mizoguchi's early life influenced the themes he would take up in his work. His father's ambitious business ventures failed and the family fell into poverty. His mother died and his beloved sister was sold into a geisha house. Her earnings paid for Mizoguchi's education. Weak and deluded men, and strong, self-sacrificing women--these were to become the obsessive motifs of Mizoguchi's films.Mizoguchi's apprenticeship in cinema was peculiarly Japanese. His concerns--the role of women and the realist representation of the inequities of Japanese society--were not. Through two World Wars, Japan's culture changed. Though censored, Mizoguchi continued to produce films. It was only in the 1950s that Mizoguchi's astonishing cinematic vision became widely known outside Japan.Kenji Mizoguchi and the Art of Japanese Cinema tells the full story of this famously perfectionist, even tyrannical, director. Mizoguchi's key films, cinematographic techniques and his social and aesthetic concerns are all discussed and set in the context of Japan's changing popular and political culture.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2008", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Bloomsbury Academic", "language": "english", "pages": "224", "ISBN10": "1847882307", "ISBN13": "9781847882301", "file": "PDF, 31.96 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2620717", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2620717/76243c"},

The result is a fresh and memorable portrait of both the man and his work which highlights the remarkable and enduring contribution to American, and world, cinema of this ever fascinating, Oscar-winning director. Author Brian Neve examines Kazan\u2019s key artistic collaborations--with actors such as Marlon Brando and James Dean and playwrights such as Tennessee Williams and John Steinbeck--and analyzes his cinematic style, from visual techniques to recurrent themes in films such as A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront. He takes an in-depth look at the controversial Congressional testimony which Kazan gave to HUAC in 1952, for which he was ostracized by many, and which often overshadowed his cinematic achievements. Neve also assesses Kazan and his films in a wider political and cultural context, tracing the evolution of the filmmaking process through the changing role of the studio, the Red Scares of the late 1940s, and the censorship debates of the 1950s and 1960s.", "categories": "Arts - Film", "year": "2008", "publisher": "I.

The Ridley Scott Encyclopedia is the first book that focuses on all aspects of his work in a wide-ranging career that spans nearly 50 years. The entries in this encyclopedia focus on all aspects of his work and are divided into four categories. The first focuses on Ridley Scott's work as a director, encompassing his feature films from The Duellists to Body of Lies, as well as his work in television, including commercials. The second category focuses on the people who have been involved in Scott's projects, including actors, directors, producers, designers, writers and other creative personnel. The third focuses on general thematic issues raised in Scott's work, such as gender construction, political issues, and geographical locations. Finally the encyclopedia incorporates entries on films by other directors who have influenced Scott's approach to his work as a director or producer.

Yves Klein and Edward Kienholz critiqued conceptions of artistic and monetary value, as Lee Lozano and Dennis Oppenheim engaged directly with the New York Stock Exchange.

There isn't a business in America that doesn't want to be more creative in its thinking, products, and processes. At many companies, being first with a concept and first to market are critical just to survive. In The Art of Innovation , Tom Kelley, general manager of the Silicon Valley based design firm IDEO, takes readers behind the scenes of this wildly imaginative and energized company to reveal the strategies and secrets it uses to turn out hit after hit.  IDEO doesn't buy into the myth of the lone genius working away in isolation, waiting for great ideas to strike. Kelley believes everyone can be creative, and the goal at his firm is to tap into that wellspring of creativity in order to make innovation a way of life. How does it do that? IDEO fosters an atmosphere conducive to freely expressing ideas, breaking the rules, and freeing people to design their own work environments. IDEO's focus on teamwork generates countless breakthroughs, fueled by the constant give-and-take among people ready to share ideas and reap the benefits of the group process. IDEO has created an intense, quick-turnaround, brainstorm-and-build process dubbed \"the Deep Dive.\"  In entertaining anecdotes, Kelley illustrates some of his firm's own successes (and joyful failures), as well as pioneering efforts at other leading companies. The book reveals how teams research and immerse themselves in every possible aspect of a new product or service, examining it from the perspective of clients, consumers, and other critical audiences.  Kelley takes the reader through the IDEO problem-solving method:  > Carefully observing the behavior or \"anthropology\" of the people who will be using a product or service  >", "categories": "Arts - Fashion, Decorative Arts & Design", "year": "2001", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Crown Business", "language": "english", "pages": "303", "ISBN10": "0385499841", "ISBN13": "9780385499842", "file": "DJVU, 2.98 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/767654/12d3eb"},

At many companies, being first with a concept and first to market are critical just to survive. In The Art of Innovation, Tom Kelley, general manager of the Silicon Valley based design firm IDEO, takes readers behind the scenes of this wildly imaginative and energized company to reveal the strategies and secrets it uses to turn out hit after hit.IDEO doesn't buy into the myth of the lone genius working away in isolation, waiting for great ideas to strike. Kelley believes everyone can be creative, and the goal at his firm is to tap into that wellspring of creativity in order to make innovation a way of life. How does it do that? IDEO fosters an atmosphere conducive to freely expressing ideas, breaking the rules, and freeing people to design their own work environments. IDEO's focus on teamwork generates countless breakthroughs, fueled by the constant give-and-take among people ready to share ideas and reap the benefits of the group process. IDEO has created an intense, quick-turnaround, brainstorm-and-build process dubbed \"the Deep Dive.\"In entertaining anecdotes, Kelley illustrates some of his firm's own successes (and joyful failures), as well as pioneering efforts at other leading companies. The book reveals how teams research and immerse themselves in every possible aspect of a new product or service, examining it from the perspective of clients, consumers, and other critical audiences.Kelley takes the reader through the IDEO problem-solving method:> Carefully observing the behavior or \"anthropology\" of the people who will be using a product or service> Brainstorming with high-energy sessions focused on tangible results> Quickly prototyping ideas and designs at every step of the way> Cross-pollinating to find solutions from other fields> Taking risks, and failing your way to success> Building a \"Greenhouse\" for innovationIDEO has won more awards in the last ten years than any other firm of its kind, and a full half-hour Nightline presentation of its creative process received one of the show's highest ratings.

This readable, thought-provoking, and multidisciplinary study explores theatrical writings that question this aesthetical-generic conception and seek instead to work with the medium of theatricality itself. Beginning with Plato, Samuel Weber tracks the uneasy relationships among theater, ethics, and philosophy through Aristotle, the major Greek tragedians, Shakespeare, Kierkegaard, Kafka, Freud, Benjamin, Artaud, and many others who develop alternatives to dominant narrative-aesthetic assumptions about the theatrical medium. His readings also interrogate the relation of theatricality to the introduction of electronic media. The result is to show that, far from breaking with the characteristics of live staged performance, the new media intensify ambivalences about place and identity already at work in theater since the Greeks. Praise for Samuel Weber: What kind of questioning is primarily after something other than an answer that can be measured . . . in cognitive terms?

When his late granddad showed him magic for the first time, Steven Frayne knew there was more to life than hiding from bullies. He had a destiny. A calling. In that moment Dynamo was born: the most exciting magician of the 21st century. Since then, Dynamo has shocked, thrilled and amazed men, women and children, from all walks of life, all over the world. With his mind-blowing illusions, he has catalysed a whole new era of magic. Now, in his very first book, Dynamo invites you to join him on a breathtaking journey across the globe. Be prepared to levitate Lindsay Lohan in Singapore, transform snow into diamonds in the Austrian mountains, and walk on water across the River Thames. Along the way, he reveals how to make the impossible possible, what it takes to pull off the greatest stunts man has seen, and why everyone needs magic in their lives. This is no illusion. This is the real story of the awe-inspiring Dynamo.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Ebury Press", "language": "english", "pages": "312", "ISBN10": "0091948924", "ISBN13": "9780091948924", "file": "EPUB, 4.01 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2220427/7f01d8"},

Written by charismatic young magician Joshua Jay, Magic combines expertise, photographs, step-by-step directions showing how to perform 100 tricks, and a DVD that demonstrates 35 of them. Joshua Jay took home the top prize at the World Magic Seminar (the Olympics of magic) when he was just 16 years old. Ten years later, he continues to perform magic, write about magic, eat, sleep, and breathe magic. Here, he brings all his passion and knowledge to teaching magic. Each trick is broken down into the Effect, the Secret, the Set-up, and, most important, the Performance, with lessons on what to say, how to direct the audience's attention, where to keep your hands, and so on. (In other words, how to be smart about the things your audience is surprisingly clueless about.)

Ferguson"], "rating": "0", "description": "Grounded equally in discussions of theater history, literary genre, and theory, Martin Puchner's  Stage Fright: Modernism, Anti-Theatricality, and Drama explores the conflict between avant-garde theater and modernism. While the avant-garde celebrated all things theatrical, a dominant strain of modernism tended to define itself against the theater, valuing lyric poetry and the novel instead. Defenders of the theater dismiss modernism's aversion to the stage and its mimicking actors as one more form of the old \"anti-theatrical\" prejudice. But Puchner shows that modernism's ambivalence about the theater was shared even by playwrights and directors and thus was a productive force responsible for some of the greatest achievements in dramatic literature and theater.A reaction to the aggressive theatricality of Wagner and his followers, the modernist backlash against the theater led to the peculiar genre of the closet drama -- a theatrical piece intended to be read rather than staged -- whose long-overlooked significance Puchner traces from the theatrical texts of Mallarm\u00e9 and Stein to the dramatic \"Circe\" chapter of Joyce's  Ulysses. At times, then, the anti-theatrical impulse leads to a withdrawal from the theater. At other times, however, it returns to the stage, when Yeats blends lyric poetry with Japanese N\u00f4h dancers, when Brecht controls the stage with novelistic techniques, and when Beckett buries his actors in barrels and behind obsessive stage directions. The modernist theater thus owes much to the closet drama whose literary strategies it blends with a new mise en sc\u00e8ne. While offering an alternative history of modernist theater and literature, Puchner also provides a new account of the contradictory forces within modernism.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2002", "language": "english", "pages": "247", "ISBN10": "0801868556", "ISBN13": "9780801877766", "file": "PDF, 2.16 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/944620", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/944620/554fec"},

Persi Diaconis and Ron Graham provide easy, step-by-step instructions for each trick, explaining how to set up the effect and offering tips on what to say and do while performing it. Each card trick introduces a new mathematical idea, and varying the tricks in turn takes readers to the very threshold of today's mathematical knowledge. For example, the Gilbreath Principle--a fantastic effect where the cards remain in control despite being shuffled--is found to share an intimate connection with the Mandelbrot set. Other card tricks link to the mathematical secrets of combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, topology, the Riemann hypothesis, and even Fermat's last theorem. Diaconis and Graham are mathematicians as well as skilled performers with decades of professional experience between them. In this book they share a wealth of conjuring lore, including some closely guarded secrets of legendary magicians. Magical Mathematics covers the mathematics of juggling and shows how the I Ching connects to the history of probability and magic tricks both old and new. It tells the stories--and reveals the best tricks--of the eccentric and brilliant inventors of mathematical magic. Magical Mathematics exposes old gambling secrets through the mathematics of shuffling cards, explains the classic street-gambling scam of three-card monte, traces the history of mathematical magic back to the thirteenth century and the oldest mathematical trick--and much more.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "258", "ISBN10": "0691151644", "ISBN13": "9780691151649", "file": "EPUB, 3.49 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1243837/53ca08"},

Acts of Authority/Acts of Resistance seeks to address that absence, as it uniquely views drama and performance as central to the practice of nationalism and anti-colonial resistance.Nandi Bhatia argues that Indian theater was a significant force in the struggle against oppressive colonial and postcolonial structures, as it sought to undo various schemes of political and cultural power through its engagement with subjects derived from mythology, history, and available colonial models such as Shakespeare. Bhatia's attention to local histories within a postcolonial framework places performance in a global and transcultural context. Drawing connections between art and politics, between performance and everyday experience, Bhatia shows how performance often intervened in political debates and even changed the course of politics.One of the first Western studies of Indian theater to link the aesthetics and the politics of that theater, Acts of Authority/Acts of Resistance combines in-depth archival research with close readings of dramatic texts performed at critical moments in history. Each chapter amplifies its themes against the backdrop of specific social conditions as it examines particular dramatic productions, from The Indigo Mirror to adaptations of Shakespeare plays by Indian theater companies, illustrating the role of theater in bringing nationalist, anticolonial, and gendered struggles into the public sphere.Nandi Bhatia is Associate Professor of English at the University of Western Ontario.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2004", "publisher": "University of Michigan Press", "language": "english", "pages": "215", "ISBN10": "0472112635", "ISBN13": "9780472112630", "file": "PDF, 1.62 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1259899", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1259899/b02eaa"},

These ten original essays, especially commissioned for  Not the Other Avant-Garde , forge a radically new conception of the avant-garde by demonstrating the many ways in which the first- and second-wave avant-gardes were always already a transnational phenomenon, an amalgam of often contradictory performance traditions and practices developed in various cultural locations around the world, including Africa, the Middle East, Mexico, Argentina, India, and Japan. Essays from leading scholars and critics-including Marvin Carlson, Sudipto Chatterjee, John Conteh-Morgan, Peter Eckersall, Harry J. Elam Jr., Joachim Fiebach, David G. Goodman, Jean Graham-Jones, Hannah Higgins, and Adam Vers?nyi-suggest collectively that the very concept of the avant-garde is possible only if conceptualized beyond the limitations of Eurocentric paradigms.   Not the Other Avant-Garde  is groundbreaking in both avant-garde studies and performance studies and will be a valuable contribution to the fields of theater studies, modernist studies, art history, literature, and music history.

Strindberg\u2019s electrifying theatrical work resonated with the public in his own lifetime, and continues to impress audiences around the globe today. A restless innovator of various dramatic forms, he served as a source of inspiration for legendary figures like Eugene O\u2019Neill, Samuel Beckett, and Ingmar Bergman, and proved seminal to the development of modern drama as we know it. Though Strindberg\u2019s preface to Miss Julie and his prefatory note to A Dream Play are well known, Strindberg\u2019s frequent commentary on drama and theatre in general are less familiar, as are most of his plays. Strindberg on Drama and Theatre presents the most important of these comments, chronologically assembled and annotated, many of them published for the first time in English. An essential resource for those interested in one of our most modern playwrights, as well as a thrilling read for the dedicated theatre lover, Strindberg on Drama and Theatre provides a fascinating look at one of our most powerful dramatic voices.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2008", "language": "english", "pages": "256 / 207", "ISBN10": "9053560203", "ISBN13": "9789048510047", "file": "PDF, 9.58 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/863670", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/863670/197df4"},

And Mame, the role Russell (1907-1976) would always be remembered for, embodies the rich and rewarding life Bernard F. Dick reveals in the first biography of this Golden Age star, Forever Mame: The Life of Rosalind Russell. Drawing on personal interviews and information from the archives of Russell and her producer-husband Frederick Brisson, Dick begins with Russell's childhood in Waterbury, Connecticut, and chronicles her early attempts to achieve recognition after graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Frustrated by her inability to land a lead in a Broadway show, she headed for Hollywood in 1934 and two years later played her first starring role, the title character in Craig's Wife. Dick discusses all of her films along with her triumphal return to Broadway, first in the musical Wonderful Town and later in Auntie Mame. Forever Mame details Russell's social circle of such stars as Loretta Young, Cary Grant, and Frank Sinatra. It traces an extraordinary career, ending with Russell's courageous battle against the two diseases that eventually caused her death: rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Russell devoted her last years to campaigning for arthritis research. So successful was she in her efforts to alert lawmakers to this crippling disease that a leading San Francisco research center is named after her. Bernard F.

Learn what's real, what's fake, and what's just downright bizarre.  You've probably heard of Tom Thumb. The Elephant Man. Chang and Eng, the original Siamese twins. But what about Eli Bowen, the legless acrobat? Myrtle Corbin, the four-legged woman? Or Prince Randian, the human torso? All these and more were stars during the heyday of the American sideshow, from 1840 to 1950. American Sideshow chronicles the lives of truly amazing performers, examining these brave and extraordinary curiosities, not just as sideshow attractions, but as people, delving into the lives they led and how they were able to triumph over their abnormalities.  American Sideshow discusses the rise and fall of the original sideshows and their subsequent replacement by today's self-made freaks. With the progress of modern medicine, the physical abnormalities are disappearing, either through treatment or prevention; and, ironically, those same technological advancements now make it possible to change our bodies at will. It's amazing how easy it is to have your tongue forked, horns surgically implanted, or your earlobes removed. There are also modern-day giants, fire-eaters, fire-breathers, sword-swallowers, glass-eaters, human blockheads, and, oh, so much more.  These fascinating personalities are celebrated through intimate biographies paired with stunning photographs. Approximately 200 performers from the past 160 years are featured, giving readers a comprehensive and sometimes astonishing view of the history of the American sideshow.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2005", "publisher": "Jeremy Tarcher/Penguin", "language": "english", "pages": "289", "ISBN10": "1585424412", "ISBN13": "9781585424412", "file": "EPUB, 6.69 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1251253/335b73"},

Jones, Cleveland Ballet Dancing Wheels, Zab Maboungou, David Dorfman, Marie Chouinard, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, and others, have helped establish dance as a crucial discourse of the 90s. These dancers, Ann Cooper Albright argues, are asking the audience to see the body as a source of cultural identity -- a physical presence that moves with and through its gendered, racial, and social meanings.Through her articulate and nuanced analysis of contemporary choreography, Albright shows how the dancing body shifts conventions of representation and provides a critical example of the dialectical relationship between cultures and the bodies that inhabit them. As a dancer, feminist, and philosopher, Albright turns to the material experience of bodies, not just the body as a figure or metaphor, to understand how cultural representation becomes embedded in the body. In arguing for the intelligence of bodies, Choreographing Difference is itself a testimonial, giving voice to some important political, moral, and artistic questions of our time.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "1997", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Wesleyan University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "247", "ISBN10": "0819563153", "ISBN13": "9780819563156", "file": "PDF, 11.03 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1161522", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1161522/23b280"},

Now a disappearing                  tradition, Tanzanian popular theatre integrates comic sketches, acrobatics,                  melodrama, song, and dance to produce lively commentaries on what it means to be                  Tanzanian. These dynamic shows invite improvisation and spontaneous and raucous                  audience participation as they explore popular sentiments. Edmondson asserts that                  these performances overturn the boundary between official and popular art and offer                  a new way of thinking about African popular culture. She discusses how the blurring                  of state agendas and local desires presents a charged environment for the                  exploration of Tanzanian political and social realities: What is the meaning of                  democracy and who gets to define it? Who is in power, and how is power exposed or                  concealed? What is the role of tradition in a postsocialist state? How will the                  future of the nation be negotiated?

Previously this was seen as pertaining almost exclusively to product usability, but new recognition is being given to ''pleasure-based'' human factors. This emphasizes the holistic nature of the experience of person-product interaction. While traditional human factors approaches tended to characterize the user in terms of his or her physical or cognitive processing capabilities, new human factors approaches are concerned with wider lifestyle issues. The quality of a design is judged not only on its fit with a person's cognitive and physical abilities but also depends on how it fits the person's lifestyle and self image -- his hopes, dreams, values, and aspirations. Under the new paradigm, human factors specialists are concerned not only with the interaction design of products, but also with the product's sensorial and aesthetic qualities. Usability may once have been a seen as an added bonus, but consumers now tend to expect a product to be usable and are disappointed if they have difficulties in use. If human factors specialists are to continue to add value to a product, then their contribution must extend beyond traditional usability issues to capture the essence of what makes a product a real joy to use. This book gives an overview of the state-of-the-art in human factors approaches, consisting of specially invited contributions from leading practitioners in both industry and academia.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2002", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "CRC Press", "language": "english", "pages": "480 / 392", "ISBN10": "0203302273", "ISBN13": "9780203355022", "file": "PDF, 11.07 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/817329", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/817329/49a185"},

In this brilliantly researched, thoughtful, and intimate biography, bestselling author Donald Spoto goes beyond the popular caricature--the abusive, unstable mother portrayed in her adopted daughter Christina Crawford's memoir, \"Mommie Dearest\"--to give us a three-dimensional portrait of a very human woman, her dazzling career, and her extraordinarily dramatic life and times. Based on new archival information and exclusive interviews, and written with Spoto's keen eye for detail, \"Possessed\" offers a fascinating portrait of a courageous, highly sexed, and ambitious woman whose strength and drive made her a forerunner in the fledgling film business. From her hardscrabble childhood in Texas to her early days as a dancer in post-World War I New York to her rise to stardom, Spoto traces Crawford's fifty years of memorable performances in classics like \"Rain,\" \"The Women,\" \"Mildred Pierce,\" and \"Sudden Fear,\" which are as startling and vivid today as when they were filmed. In \"Possessed,\" Spoto goes behind the myths to examine the rise and fall of the studio system; Crawford's four marriages; her passionate thirty year, on-and-off-again affair with Clark Gable; her friendships and rivalries with other stars; her powerful desire to become a mother; the truth behind the scathing stories in her daughter Christina's memoir; and her final years as a widow battling cancer. Spoto explores Crawford's achievements as an actress, her work with Hollywood's great directors (Frank Borzage, George Cukor, Otto Preminger) and actors (Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Spencer Tracy, John Barrymore), and later, her role as a highly effective executive on the board of directors of Pepsi-Cola.

A theatrical event includes the presentation of a performance and the attention of an audience; in this sense, every performance\u2014on stage or in the street, historical or contemporary\u2014that is watched by an audience is a theatrical event. The concept underlines the \u201ceventness\u201d of all encounters between performers and spectators.    In the ?rst part of the book, Willmar Sauter presents various models for the analysis of theatrical events, examining the relationship between performance and perception and the interaction between the performative event and its context. Using examples from ancient and recent theatre history and discussing traditional and nontraditional approaches to theatre theory, he builds a paradigmatic change in the concept of theatre. Constructs such as playing culture (as opposed to written culture), theatrical communication, theatricality, and theatre as a model of cultural event are brought into focus and their methodological advantages explored.    The second part of the book uses the theoretical groundwork of the ?rst part to enhance a variety of topics, including such legends as Sarah Bernhardt and other historical phenomena such as a Swedish Renaissance play, Strindberg's ideas on acting, the question of ethnicity in the political theatre of the 1930s, and critical writings on contemporary performances. Sauter examines how Robert Lepage's staging of A Dream Play is viewed by critics and scholars and analyzes Dario Fo's intercultural transfer to outdoor performances in Stockholm and the unusual sensationalism of Strindberg's Miss Julie.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2000", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University Of Iowa Press", "language": "english", "pages": "287", "ISBN10": "087745731X", "ISBN13": "9780877457312", "file": "PDF, 2.22 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/933792", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/933792/d85864"},

However, when done well, fight and action scenes support and heighten the story and expand the characters. Fight Choreography: The Art of Non-Verbal Dialogue helps filmmakers ensure that the fight scenes in their films add to the film's overall quality. Creating a stage fight with a high level of clarity and entertainment value is a very complicated endeavor and requires skills that acting classes and martial arts schools cannot teach. This book helps filmmakers make sense of this art form and how they can use it to create their own styles of fights for a variety of projects, whether they be feature-length films, shorts, or television shows. The book is instructional, informative, and entertaining, and focuses on every important element involved in fight choreography, from basic philosophies, initial concept, and planning, to filming, editing, adding special effects, and sound mixing the final product. The book is not only an indispensable resource for filmmakers, but will also interestfilm buffs who want to learn how great fight sequences are made so they can better appreciate the action.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2008", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Thomson Course Technology", "language": "english", "pages": "544 / 545", "ISBN10": "1592006809", "ISBN13": "9781592006793", "file": "PDF, 4.71 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1071984", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1071984/8fa519"},

In short order, Lilian Alicia Marks would become a dance prodigy, the cherished baby ballerina of Sergei Diaghilev, and the youngest ever soloist at his famed Ballets Russes. It was there that George Balanchine choreographed his first ballet for her, Henri Matisse designed her costumes, and Igor Stravinsky taught her music - all when the re-christened Alicia Markova was just 14. But the timid British dancer would be forced to overcome poverty, jealousy, anti-Semitism, and prejudices against her unconventional looks to become the greatest classical ballerina of her generation - and one of the most celebrated, self-reliant, and adventurous. A true ambassador of ballet, Markova co-founded touring companies, traveled to the far corners of the world, and was the first ballerina to appear on television. Given unprecedented access to Dame Markova\u2019s intimate journals and correspondence, Tina Sutton paints a full picture of the dancer\u2019s astonishing life and times in 1920s Paris and Monte Carlo, 1930s London, and wartime in New York and Hollywood.

Each section - ''Queries'', ''Texts'', ''Contexts'' and ''Practice'' - frames this confluence according to certain common threads that emerge from essays that deal with topics from the ethics of autobiographical performance, the political efficacy of verbatim theatre, the challenges of community-based performance, political and self-censorship, and the impossibility of representing atrocity.

Simply put, students are more engaged, misbehave less, and learn better from teachers who teach enthusiastically. A teacher's enthusiasm for his or her subject matter can be contagious. Since the dynamic of the classroom is similar to that of the stage in terms of speaker-listener relationships, the acting craft offers teachers a model for the skills and strategies that could be incorporated in their work to convey more enthusiasm for the material and for the students.This book presents concrete descriptions of the specific acting strategies that would benefit the teacher: physical and vocal animation, teacher role-playing, strategic entrances and exits, humor, props, suspense and surprise, and creative use of space. Special attention is given to the potential advantage of instructional technology as a modern-day prop. Strategies are explained in terms of their importance and ease of incorporation into the classroom. Each is proposed as a skill that can be learned by any teachers who have the desire to enliven their teaching. Student descriptions of their own experience with teachers' use of acting strategies add real examples for each lesson. Finally, testimony of award-winning classroom teachers from a variety of disciplines and age levels provides evidence of the wide and easy applicability of these strategies.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2006", "edition": "2", "publisher": "Praeger", "language": "english", "pages": "241", "ISBN10": "027599192X", "ISBN13": "9780275991920", "file": "PDF, 2.22 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/808384", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/808384/76b6c9"},

Because of his liberal activities in the film community, including co-founding of the Committee for the First Amendment, Knox was \"grey-listed,\" and forced to settle permanently in the United Kingdom, where he became a familiar figure both in films and on television. On Actors and Acting collects together Knox's writings, published and unpublished, on various performers with whom he worked or was familiar, and on the art and craft of acting. Knox writes on Laurence Olivier, a close personal friend with whom he appeared in the memorable 1940 production of Romeo and Juliet. He discusses his performance as Wilson.

Wollman takes readers on a fascinating tour of the adult musical scene of New York City's rampant 1970s. After the success of Hair in 1968, the low-budget adult musical proliferated. The most famous was the long-running \"Oh! Calcutta!\", but countless more made it to stage: \"Stag Movie,\" \"Let My People Come,\" \"The Faggot,\" and others. Structured like old-fashioned revues, with thematically interconnected songs and skits, they received little respect from critics, who either condemned them for going too far in the direction of hard-core pornography, or for not being erotic enough. The public thought otherwise, flooding the theaters and pouring cash into box-office tills. Wollman shows that adult musicals represented far more than a silly fad from a silly decade: they reflected experimentation with newfound sexual freedom, not to mention the rise of the women's and gay liberation movements. She examines the impact of the Stonewall riots on gay musicals; how feminism was reflected on stage; and how \"porno chic\" and hard-core porn influenced performances. Even the most middlebrow efforts brought into focus the debate between art and obscenity, and angst over New York City's socioeconomic status. By the early 1980s, as the city's economy recovered and society grew conservative, these musicals disappeared-an indicator of a larger transformation.Wollman reasserts the significance of this humble (if hardly modest) art form. Adult musicals, she shows, represented aspects of American culture at their messiest and most confused-and thus at their most honest.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "268", "ISBN10": "0199747482", "ISBN13": "9780199747481", "file": "PDF, 2.74 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2031849", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2031849/b332d5"},

Persi Diaconis and Ron Graham provide easy, step-by-step instructions for each trick, explaining how to set up the effect and offering tips on what to say and do while performing it. Each card trick introduces a new mathematical idea, and varying the tricks in turn takes readers to the very threshold of today's mathematical knowledge. For example, the Gilbreath Principle--a fantastic effect where the cards remain in control despite being shuffled--is found to share an intimate connection with the Mandelbrot set. Other card tricks link to the mathematical secrets of combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, topology, the Riemann hypothesis, and even Fermat's last theorem. Diaconis and Graham are mathematicians as well as skilled performers with decades of professional experience between them. In this book they share a wealth of conjuring lore, including some closely guarded secrets of legendary magicians. Magical Mathematics covers the mathematics of juggling and shows how the I Ching connects to the history of probability and magic tricks both old and new. It tells the stories--and reveals the best tricks--of the eccentric and brilliant inventors of mathematical magic. Magical Mathematics exposes old gambling secrets through the mathematics of shuffling cards, explains the classic street-gambling scam of three-card monte, traces the history of mathematical magic back to the thirteenth century and the oldest mathematical trick--and much more.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "258", "ISBN10": "0691151644", "ISBN13": "9780691151649", "file": "MOBI , 4.01 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1243836/47efcd"},

While scientists and theorists investigated the law and order of nature, show business was more concerned with what was out of the natural order.

Focusing on popular theatre forms in London, New York and Paris, Jane Goodall shows how they were interwoven with the developing debate about human evolution.With this book, Goodall contributes an important new angle to the debates surrounding the history of evolution.

Today Rogers is considered America\u2019s most beloved humorist, while Ziegfeld is recognized as the most flamboyant impresario in the history of the American musical theatre.Rogers was one of Ziegfeld\u2019s greatest comedy stars, performing in six editions of the Follies from 1916 to 1925.  \"Ziggy gave me my start,\" he once said.  It was on the Follies stage that he began to joke extensively about current events and to poke fun at celebrities.Will Rogers at the Ziegfeld Follies features the humorist\u2019s writings and poignant observations on society during World War I and the Roaring Twenties.  Included in this unique collection are two of Rogers\u2019 most popular books, The Cowboy Philosopher on the Peace Conference and The Cowboy Philosopher on Prohibition.  In selections from his weekly articles and The Illiterate Digest, Rogers lampoons the leading figures of the day, from Henry Ford and William Jennings Bryan to Presidents Wilson, Harding, and Coolidge.In these pages the reader will discover how the Follies brought national fame to Rogers and led him to new careers as a newspaper columnist, film star, radio performer, and popular speaker.  His extraorginarily versatile talent is demonstrated by his first syndicated newspaper column, comic routines from his Victor phonograph recordings, a speech to the American Bankers\u2019 Association, and many other witty pieces that are still very relevant to our own time.Included here are Rogers writings that have never been published: selections from the entertainer\u2019s gag book, notes, and correspondence.  In a fascinating exchange of telegrams and letters, the book brings to life the rare friendship between Rogers and Ziegfeld.  It also spotlights Will\u2019s relationship with two other famous Ziegfeld comedians, Eddie Cantor and W.C. Fields.As the only book dealing with Will Rogers on the stage, this volume fills an important gap in the life story of the humorist.

Mortimer", "Julio Cortazar"], "rating": "0", "description": "At a time when most serious drama being written and produced for the American stage aspires only to mainstream acceptance and high-toned mediocrity, an innovative new generation of playwrights based in New York City has emerged, crafting works that challenge and undermine the conventional structure, language, and characterization of commercial theater while rejecting outdated notions of the avant-garde.     New Downtown Now brings together ten new works that exemplify the playfulness, excitement, and possibilities of the theater. Characterized by fragmenting structure, hypnotic rhythms, kaleido-scopic imagery, unpredictable characters, and lyrical language, these plays resemble puzzles from which the writers are teasing revelations. Though disparate in subject matter and style, with characters ranging from a sushi chef to a soldier and settings from a taxicab to a live television broadcast, these highly original plays share a commitment to formal experimentation that places them beyond the psychological clich\u00e9s of the majority and the cold condescension of postmodernism.     The anthology includes Interim by Barbara Cassidy; Tragedy: a tragedy by Will Eno; Nine Come by Elana Greenfield; Shufu-Sachiko and Enoshima Island by Madelyn Kent; The Appeal by Young Jean Lee; The Vomit Talk of Ghosts by Kevin Oakes; Ajax (por nobody) by Alice Tuan; Apparition, an uneasy play of the underknown by Anne Washburn; Demon Baby by Erin Courtney.    Mac Wellman is the author of numerous plays and the recipient of three Obie awards, most recently in 2003 for lifetime achievement. He is professor of playwriting at Brooklyn College.     Young Jean Lee is a playwright and director, and member of the Obie award-winning company 13P.     Jeffrey M.

Hewson", "Michael Bury", "Anthea Holme"], "rating": "0", "description": "As music columnist for The Nation, Gene Santoro has established himself as an important new critical voice, able to write well on a broad spectrum of popular music and jazz without losing touch with the cutting edge of today's music scene. About Nat \"King\" Cole, Santoro comments: \"adjectives can't describe the swinging, ingratiating self-confidence laced with tenderness that colors Nat \"King\" Cole's singing. His baritone/tenor is so airy and elemental, so palpably physical, it invites you in, then surrounds you glowingly...\" And on the highly successful rock band Living Colour, Santoro is no less evocative: \"hardcore metal raveups slam into bluesy ballads and psychedelicized pop, lilting Caribbean inflections collide with hiphop scrambles of prerecorded material and touches of funk.\" Dancing in Your Head gathers Santoro's liveliest reviews and essays for the first time, introducing a fresh and provocative perspective on several decades of musicians and their work. Santoro covers a wide musical vista, from the legendary blues singer Robert Johnson to Public Enemy's controversial rap lyrics, from the long running clash between blues and African American gospel to the rock iconoclast Neil Young, from the great James Brown to George Hay, the founder of the Grand Ole Opry. Documenting the evolution of jazz, rock and roll, and rap, Santoro's observations are incisive, honest, and reflective. Of his early exposure to Jimi Hendrix, John Coltrane and Bela Bartok, Santoro remarks, \"That sense of wonder and discovery is what happens when you've been hit by art's immediate vatic power. It has never left me, has been touched and renewed by each encounter I've valued.\" Santoro examines the staying power of music legends Lou Reed, Eric Clapton, the Grateful Dead, and Sun Ra, the freewheeling jazz artist who prefers to call himself a tone artist rather than a musician. Special highlights include several pieces on Miles Davis; book reviews, including one on Gunther Schuller's two-volume History of Jazz; a lively and detailed profile of the Neville Brothers; and a discussion of jazz great Ornette Coleman that compares him to Orson Welles and Charles Ives. Taken together the pieces in Dancing In Your Head examine the historical roots of today's popular music while offering insight into performers and trends that dominate the current scene. Balancing a critical and historical sensibility with an unharnessed enthusiasm for all forms of music, Santoro is an ideal guide to the old and new.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "1995", "language": "english", "pages": "320 / 321", "ISBN10": "0195101235", "ISBN13": "9781423740544", "file": "PDF, 14.85 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/934390", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/934390/2d858c"},

Menander's romantic comedies--which focus on ordinary citizens who marry for love--are most often thought of as entertainments devoid of political content. Against the view, Susan Lape argues that Menander's comedies are explicitly political. His nationalistic comedies regularly conclude by performing the laws of democratic citizen marriage, thereby promising the generation of new citizens. His transnational comedies, on the other hand, defend polis life against the impinging Hellenistic kingdoms, either by transforming their representatives into proper citizen-husbands or by rendering them ridiculous, romantic losers who pose no real threat to citizen or city. In elaborating the political work of romantic comedy, this book also demonstrates the importance of gender, kinship, and sexuality to the making of democratic civic ideology. Paradoxically, by championing democratic culture against various Hellenistic outsiders, comedy often resists the internal status and gender boundaries on which democratic culture was based. Comedy's ability to reproduce democratic culture in scandalous fashion exposes the logic of civic inclusion produced by the contradictions in Athens's desperately politicized gender system. Combining careful textual analysis with an understanding of the context in which Menander wrote, Reproducing Athens profoundly changes the way we read his plays and deepens our understanding of Athenian democratic culture.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2004", "language": "english", "pages": "294 / 312", "ISBN10": "0691115834", "file": "PDF, 1.38 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1267186", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1267186/ba21c7"},

Wolfe"], "rating": "0", "description": "This is the first book to integrate practical description and theoretical analysis of the recent work of Jerzy Grotowski, the founder of Objective Drama and one of the most radical and dynamic theatre directors and performance theorists of the twentieth century. Grotowski states that Objective Drama incorporates \"those elements of the ancient rituals of various world cultures which have a precise and therefore objective impact on participants.\" First known for his legendary productions with the Teatr Laboratorium in Wroclaw, Poland, Grotowski abandoned his career as a stage director at the height of his international renown. He embarked on multifaceted research that carried him away from theatre and toward its cultural intersection with performance, ritual studies, and anthropology. His experimental research coalesced as Objective Drama, his longterm program at the University of California-Irvine. For more than seven years Lisa Wolford, the author of this study, has been closely associated with Grotowski both as a writer and as an active participant in Objective Drama. Here, as she details the practical, performing structures that originated in his workshops, she reveals the uniquely Grotowskian forms that emerged. Her focus is upon Grotowski's development of performances based on songs of American Shakers, the short stories of Hawthorne, and Haitian rituals. She discusses also his influence on director James Slowiak, particularly Slowiak's performances evolving from indigenous American materials. Because it brings attention to the recent work of this titan theorist and director this volume is of great importance to performers, directors, and all who are interested in the history of theatre and performance.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "1996", "publisher": "Univ.

It traces the history of the form from some of its earliest manifestations in the silent film era, through the historic avant-garde, musicals and music videos to contemporary experimental short dancefilms. In so doing it also examines some of the most significant collaborations between dancers, choreographers, and filmmakers.  The book also sets out to examine and rethink the parameters of dancefilm and thereby re-conceive the relations between dance and cinema. Dancefilm is understood as a modality that challenges familiar models of cinematic motion through its relation to the body, movement and time, instigating new categories of filmic performance and creating spectatorial experiences that are grounded in the somatic. Drawing on debates in both film theory (in particular ideas of gesture, the close up, and affect) and dance theory (concepts such as radical phrasing, the gestural anacrusis and somatic intelligence) and bringing these two fields into dialogue, the book argues that the combination of dance and film produces cine-choreographic practices that are specific to the dancefilm form. The book thus presents new models of cinematic movement that are both historically informed and thoroughly interdisciplinary.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "241", "ISBN10": "0199710309", "ISBN13": "9780199710300", "file": "PDF, 3.97 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1183057", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1183057/8bfa08"},

Most modern critical studies of the ballet d'action treat it more narrowly as stage dance, and very few view it as part of the history of mime. Little use has previously been made of the most revealing musical evidence. This innovative book does justice to the distinctive hybrid nature of the ballet d'action by taking a comparative approach, using contemporary literature and literary criticism, music, mime and dance from a wide range of English and European sources.

If you've ever wondered what to do with all those products, then this book is for you. If you've been using acrylic in traditional painting forms, in this book you'll find grand, wild and inventive manipulations of acrylic that will get your creative juices flowing. Compared to more traditional art mediums such as oil and watercolor, acrylic is still in its infancy. But what it lacks in years, it makes up for in its range of use. Acrylics appeared on the market for artists in the late 1940s as a quick-drying alternative to oil paint. In its early manifestations, it dried so quickly that more than a few brushes stuck immediately to the canvas! Although acrylic has been around for more than fifty years, incredible advances continue to be made in the research and development of acrylic polymers and pigments. These advancements are attributable not only to the efforts of a few dedicated chemists, but also to the work of an entire community devoted to acrylic. There are a lot of brilliant minds taking these minute molecules very seriously.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2008", "edition": "Spi", "publisher": "North Light Books", "language": "english", "pages": "160", "ISBN10": "1600610137", "ISBN13": "9781600610134", "file": "EPUB, 20.70 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1310964/cde3e6"},

Kristeva Reframed examines key ideas in Kristeva's work to show how they are most relevant to artists, and how they can be applied in interpreting artworks. With examples from the paintings of Van Gogh and Picasso, the work of contemporary feminist painters, the photography of Bill Henson and the film and animation work of Van Sowerine, Estelle Barrett demonstrates how Kristeva can illuminate the relationships between artist and art object, between artists, artworks and audiences, and between art and knowledge. Through these relationships she explores what Kristeva's work reveals about the role and function of art in society and offers a smooth passage through Kristeva's ideas and her relevance to visual culture.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2011", "publisher": "I.

A legendary art world figure, he worked as an artist, filmmaker,                  photographer, collector, author, and designer. Beginning in the 1950s as a                  commercial artist, he went on to produce work for exhibition in galleries and                  museums. The range of his efforts soon expanded to the making of films, photography,                  video, and books. Warhol first came to public notice in the 1960s through works that                  drew on advertising, brand names, and newspaper stories and headlines. Many of his                  best-known images, both single and in series, were produced within the context of                  pop art. Warhol was a major figure in the bridging of the gap between high and low                  art, and his mode of production in the famous studio known as \"The Factory\" involved                  the recognition of art making as one form of enterprise among others. The radical                  nature of that enterprise has ensured the iconic status of his art and person.Andy                  Warhol contains illustrated essays by Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, Thomas Crow, Hal                  Foster, Rosalind Krauss, Annette Michelson, and Nan Rosenthal, plus a previously                  unpublished interview with Warhol by Buchloh.

Clarke", "Victor V.J.", "Arshad Khan"], "rating": "0", "description": "\"The glory that was Rome\" has become proverbial.  But John R. Clarke, a professor of the history of art, argues that the monuments of that glory, like the Arch of Constantine and the portraits of emperors, are not the full story.  There was other Roman art, like wall paintings and mosaics, which, especially if they were decorations in ordinary houses in Pompeii, were not previously regarded as art within art history.  When Clarke first began studying Roman art, these were objects of study in the everyday life of Romans.  This has changed, and \"everyday\" art of the Romans has become a respected target for academic study, not only for itself but for what it can tell us about the majority of Romans.  In _Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans: Visual Representation and Non-Elite Viewers in Italy, 100 B.C. - A.D. 315_ (University of California Press), Clarke lays out the importance of art made or commissioned by such lowly ones as slaves, former slaves, and freeborn workers.  Emperors and the wealthy represented themselves in artwork carrying out official and prestigious practices that would demonstrate their importance.  Non-elites tended more to want to depict ordinary acts, working, drinking, even brawling.  It isn't surprising that the \"unofficial\" art could tell us more about daily Roman life.Clarke does begin by discussing how non-elites viewed the official art of the emperors, and then proceeds to the art that non-elites produced.  There are many examples here of art in domestic shrines, business-advertising, status boasting, and humor-provoking.  Clarke speculates, for example, that a painting from Pompeii previously thought to depict a man selling bread is actually a man giving out a bread dole.  There is no evidence of commerce; the receivers of the bread are exultant and do not themselves give up money.  The painting comes from a small house, not that of an elite citizen.  Clarke says that most likely this is the house of a baker who was prosperous, decided that at some point he would give bread away, and wanted to be depicted in his act of charity.  Viewers of his painting would have been reminded of the event, and the baker's prestige would have risen.  A completely different commemoration of a particular event is the painting from another house of a riot in the Pompeian amphitheater.  This depicted a real event arising somehow from hooliganism during games between the home and visiting teams, an event that caused Rome to forbid all gladiatorial shows in Pompeii for ten years.  The owner of the house went to the trouble of having an event that might be thought of as shameful commemorated on his walls.  Clarke gives evidence, from the placement of the picture and the subject, that the owner was a gladiatorial fan, who honored the gladiators by putting on display a commemoration of a riot held in their honor, perhaps a riot in which he himself took a glorious part.  Unlike the citizen who wanted people to remember the honorable act of giving out bread, the fan (and his buddies) liked remembering how the Roman social order could be disrupted.Clarke's book is a serious academic tome, complete with scads of footnotes and a huge bibliography.  It is, however, written in an engaging style.  Clarke is careful to state when he is speculating from incomplete evidence, but even when he does speculate, the evidence is good, and his argument is convincing that art commissioned by these commoners is not a trickled-down version of the works of their betters, but something vibrant and significant to be appreciated on its own.  The book is beautifully produced, on glossy paper with, as is fitting, many illustrations.  The wealth of the patron, and the skill of the artist, may have put limits upon these works, but they show enormous creative breadth and, in Clarke's interpretations, surprising utility.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2003", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "397", "ISBN10": "0520219767", "ISBN13": "9781417523320", "file": "PDF, 7.57 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/702624", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/702624/84f384"},

Inside, multicolored frescoes depict scenes from courtly life and the hunt, along with musicians, dancing girls, and naked bathing women. The traveler is transported to the luxurious and erotic world of a mid-eighth-century Muslim Arab prince. For scholars, though, Qusayr 'Amra, probably painted in the 730s or 740s, has proved a mirage, its concreteness dissolved by doubts about date, patron, and meaning. This is the first book-length contextualization of the mysterious monument through a compelling analysis of its iconography and of the literary sources for the Umayyad period. It illuminates not only the way of life of the early Muslim elite but also the long afterglow of late antique Syria.

These articles provide an unusual window onto the New York art scene just as it was casting off provincialism in favor of a more international outlook. On a deeper level, the columns probe beneath the surface of modern art, revealing an alienation that Mumford believed symptomatic of a larger cultural disintegration. Many of the themes Mumford addresses overlap with those of his more familiar architectural criticism: the guiding role of the past in stimulating creativity in the present, the increasing congestion of the modern metropolis, the alarming lack of human control over modern technology, and the pressing need to restore organic balance to everyday living. Though he was open to new movements emanating from Europe, Mumford became the chief advocate of a progressive American modernism that was both socially aware and formally inventive.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "281", "ISBN10": "0520258088", "ISBN13": "9781429457262", "file": "PDF, 1.58 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1070983", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1070983/b73de0"},

The sources of other images on his canvases give his work a brooding violence. Although modest in scale and sensitive in execution, this work is powerful in its haunting evocation of lost lives and repressed histories. In general Tuymans' works are painted in groups for each show and with the venue and the exhibition space in mind. For example, when he represented his country in the Belgian Pavilion at the 2001 Venice Biennial, Tuymans produced a cycle of works based on the murder of the first post-independence Prime Minister of the Congo, Patrice Lumumba. Other works in the cycle show images of African sculpture copies from a statue in a Belgian restaurant and images from the Belgian Royal Museum's African collection. These works raised issues about colonialism and post-colonialism, but also came at a time when a parliamentary commission was investigating the links between the Belgian government and royal family's policies and the death of Lumumba.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2003", "edition": "Rev Exp", "publisher": "Phaidon Press", "language": "english", "pages": "264", "ISBN10": "0714842982", "ISBN13": "9780714842981", "file": "PDF, 43.21 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1047693", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1047693/f0f413"},

Her discovery, which she published in Before Writing: From Counting to Cuneiform and How Writing Came About, was widely reported in professional journals and the popular press. In 1999, American Scientist chose How Writing Came About as one of the \"100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science.\"   In When Writing Met Art, Schmandt-Besserat expands her history of writing into the visual realm of communication. Using examples of ancient Near Eastern writing and masterpieces of art, she shows that between 3500 and 3000 BC the conventions of writing--everything from its linear organization to its semantic use of the form, size, order, and placement of signs--spread to the making of art, resulting in artworks that presented complex visual narratives in place of the repetitive motifs found on preliterate art objects. Schmandt-Besserat then demonstrates art's reciprocal impact on the development of writing. She shows how, beginning in 2700-2600 BC, the inclusion of inscriptions on funerary and votive art objects emancipated writing from its original accounting function. To fulfill its new role, writing evolved to replicate speech; this in turn made it possible to compile, organize, and synthesize unlimited amounts of information; and to preserve and disseminate information across time and space.   Schmandt-Besserat's pioneering investigation of the interface between writing and art documents a key turning point in human history, when two of our most fundamental information media reciprocally multiplied their capacities to communicate.

The political and socio-economic developments that have influenced the growth of modern India have been dealt with in independent chapters.The endeavour has been to present complex and truly vast material in a brief and easy-to-understand manner, and we hope our readers find the book of use and interest.The present edition includes chapters on the advent of the Europeans in India and the British consolidation of power in India besides incorporating additional information under several chapters. There are also chapters on the challenges that a newly independent nation faced in the wake of a brutal partition. The Nehruvian era is also briefly discussed. The chapter on India after Nehru discusses various developments under the governments that came after 1964. In the Appendices,a survey of personalities associated with various movements is given.

This volume takes a different approach, suggesting instead that a history of art based on national divisions often obscures the processes of cultural appropriation and global exchange that shaped the visual arts of Europe in fundamental ways between 1492 and the early twentieth century. Essays here analyze distinct zones of contact--between various European states, between Asia and Europe, or between Europe and so-called primitive cultures in Africa, the Americas, and the South Pacific--focusing mainly but not exclusively on painting, drawing, or the decorative arts. Each case foregrounds the centrality of international borrowings or colonial appropriations and counters conceptions of European art as a \"pure\" tradition uninfluenced by the artistic forms of other cultures. The contributors analyze the social, cultural, commercial, and political conditions of cultural contact--including tourism, colonialism, religious pilgrimage, trade missions, and scientific voyages--that enabled these exchanges well before the modern age of globalization.Contributors: Claire Farago, University of Colorado at BoulderElisabeth A.

His text struggles with Artaud's language and is punctuated by footnotes and asides that reflect this strain (\"How will they translate this?\"). The more straightforward text of Paule Thevenin describes the history of Artaud's drawings and portraits. Due to a dispute between Artaud's heirs and Paule Thevenin, the book does not contain reproductions of Artaud's artwork.

Creighton Gilbert s study draws on previously overlooked documents to explain the commissioning of this extraordinary cycle of paintings, begun by Fra Angelico in the early 1400s and completed a half-century later by Luca Signorelli. In contrast to most other art historians, who ascribe the iconographic and formal structure of the paintings to Signorelli, Gilbert contends that his predecessor, Fra Angelico, devised the entire program of decoration. Gilbert also situates the cycle in the contexts of liturgical practice, humanistic studies, and the rich body of texts and images shaping the Renaissance conception of the coming of the Antichrist and the world s final moments.How Fra Angelico and Signorelli Saw the End of the World examines every element in the Cappella Nuova's architecture and complex decoration, which not only represents the coming of the Antichrist, the end of the world, and the Last Judgment but also, on a high dado, features portraits of Dante and other poets, scenes from their texts, and sinuous grotesque ornament. Although Dante s likeness has long been recognized, Gilbert is the first scholar to establish that his great epic, The Divine Comedy, exerted a profound influence on the Chapel s iconographic program.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2003", "publisher": "Pennsylvania State University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "221", "ISBN10": "0271021403", "ISBN13": "9780271021409", "file": "PDF, 1.11 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1250120", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1250120/a950a4"},

This narrative account, from the earliest cave paintings up to the present day, has new things to say about almost every period of art. Taking account of changing scholarship and shifting opinions, he draws our attention to a number of neglected artists and styles, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, Russia and the Americas. Paul Johnson puts the creative originality of the individual at the heart of his story. He pays particular attention to key periods: the emergence of the artistic personality in the Renaissance, the new realism of the early seventeenth century, the discovery of landscape painting as a separate art form, and the rise of ideological art. He notes the division of 'fashion art' and fine art at the beginning of the twentieth century, and how it has now widened. Though challenging and controversial, Paul Johnson is not primarily a revisionist. He is a passionate lover of beauty who finds creativity in many places. With 300 colour illustrations, this book is vivid, evocative and immensely readable, whether the author is describing the beauty of Egyptian low-relief carving or the medieval cathedrals of Europe, the watercolours of Thomas Girtin or the utility of Roman bridges ('the best bridges in history'), the genius of Andrew Wyeth or the tranquility of the Great Mosque at Damascus, the paintings of Ilya Repin or a carpet-page from the Lindisfarne Gospels.

Danto en el a\u00f1o 1995.En alguno de sus textos, Arthur Danto ya hab\u00eda situado el fin del arte exactamente en los a\u00f1os sesenta. Sin embargo, y a pesar de esta afirmaci\u00f3n radical, ha continuado efectuando una cr\u00edtica radical de la naturaleza del arte en nuestro tiempo. Despu\u00e9s del fin del arte presenta la primera reformulaci\u00f3n a gran escala de esa intuici\u00f3n de Danto y muestra c\u00f3mo, tras el eclipse del expresionismo abstracto, el arte se ha desviado irrevocablemente del curso narrativo que Vassari defini\u00f3 para \u00e9l en el Renacimiento, de modo que lo que debe hacerse es se\u00f1alar el camino hacia un nuevo tipo de cr\u00edtica que resulte capaz de ayudarnos a entender el arte en esta era posthist\u00f3rica: un tiempo en el que, por ejemplo, las teor\u00edas tradicionales no pueden explicar la diferencia entre una obra de Andy Warhol y el producto comercial en el que se inspira.Se trata, pues, de plasmar una serie de consideraciones, tan rigurosas como amenas, sobre los m\u00e1s relevantes temas est\u00e9ticos y filos\u00f3ficos con respecto al arte que, a su vez, reflejan a la perfecci\u00f3n el pensamiento de uno de los observadores m\u00e1s atentos de la escena est\u00e9tica actual.

Mitter casts his gaze across a myriad of issues, including the emergence of a feminine voice in Indian art, the decline of \u201coriental art,\u201d and the rise of naturalism and modernism in the 1920s. Nationalist politics also played a large role, from the struggle of artists in reconciling Indian nationalism with imperial patronage of the arts to the relationship between primitivism and modernism in Indian art. \u00a0An engagingly written study anchored by 150 lush reproductions, The Triumph of Modernism will be essential reading for scholars of art, British studies, and Indian history.

V. Jones"], "rating": "0", "description": "In this book Martha Buskirk addresses the interesting fact that since the early 1960s, almost anything can and has been called art. Among other practices, contemporary artists have employed mass-produced elements, impermanent materials, and appropriated imagery, have incorporated performance and video, and have created works through instructions carried out by others. Furthermore, works of art that lack traditional signs of authenticity or permanence have been embraced by institutions long devoted to the original and the permanent.    Buskirk begins with questions of authorship raised by minimalists' use of industrial materials and methods, including competing claims of ownership and artistic authorship evident in conflicts over the right to fabricate artists' works. Examining recent examples of appropriation, she finds precedents in pop art and the early twentieth-century readymade and explores the intersection of contemporary artistic copying and the system of copyrights, trademarks, and brand names characteristic of other forms of commodity production. She also investigates the ways that connections between work and context have transformed art and institutional conventions, the impact of new materials on definitions of medium, the role of the document as both primary and secondary object, and the significance of conceptually oriented performance work for the intersection of photography and the human body in contemporary art.    Buskirk explores how artists active in the 1980s and 1990s have recombined strategies of the art of the 1960s and 1970s. She also shows how the mechanisms through which art is presented shape not only readings of the work but the work itself. She uses her discussion of the readymade and conceptual art to explore broader issues of authorship, reproduction, context, and temporality.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2003", "language": "english", "pages": "317 / 318", "ISBN10": "0262025396", "ISBN13": "9780585478807", "file": "PDF, 8.74 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/849518", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/849518/a4b0dd"},

Stallabrass notes that the spectacular crash of 1989 profoundly changed the character of contemporary art, shattering the art-world's self-importance and producing a reaction against art that engaged with theory and politics, in favor of art that set out to awe, entertain, and be sold. He describes the growth of biennials and other art events across the globe in the 1990s, the construction of new museums of contemporary art, and the expansion of many museums already in existence. These activities, Stallabrass writes, have become steadily more commercial, as museums establish alliances with corporations, bring their products closer to commercial culture, and move from modeling themselves on libraries to becoming more like theme parks. In connection with this, he offers an insightful look at installation art, which is often seen as an art that firmly resists buying and selling, pointing out that installations appeal to museums precisely because a work of art that can only be seen on a particular site ensures that viewers have to go there.      Shedding light on everything from the greatly increased visibility for women artists, to the intense competition between art and television, to the conservative backlash against notorious works, Art Incorporated provides a frank and penetrating view of the contemporary art world.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2004", "edition": "1st", "language": "english", "pages": "240 / 248", "ISBN10": "0192801651", "ISBN13": "9781429487146", "file": "PDF, 2.55 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/905470", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/905470/79425e"},

Nearly 500 of these grotto temples remain. This volume of symposium proceedings marks the culmination of a unique three-year Getty Conservation Institute collaborative project with the Chinese authorities and discusses various approaches to site managementas well as conservation principles and practice and geotechnical and environmental issues.THE GETTY CONSERVATION INSTITUTE is committed to the preservation of the world\u2019s cultural heritage and, as such, seeks to find ways to enhance the knowledge and information available to conservation professionals as well as to a broader audience. These proceedings are part of that commitment. They have been long in the making, but waiting for them has been worthwhile.The International Conference on the Conservation of Ancient Sites on the Silk Road, sponsored by the Getty Conservation Institute together with China\u2019s Dunhuang Academy and State Bureau of Cultural Relics, took place in October 1993 at the Mogao grottoes, Dunhuang, the People\u2019s Republic of China. Since then, several other meetings have been held. They all shared in the objectives of the initial conference: to bring together an international panel of specialists from a wide range of disciplines to provide a critical mass of expertise that would or could be applied to solving the difficult and numerous problems that threaten some of the world\u2019s most imposing and important cultural heritage sites, the magnificent Buddhist grottoes on the Silk Road.Grottoes pose particularly thorny problems for conservation. They require a fundamentally holistic view if the conservation approach is going to be valuable in the long term. At the same time\u2014because of their magnitude, geographic location, richness and variety of materials, unique microclimates, continuing use as religious sites, and growing attraction for tourists\u2014the Buddhist grottoes of the Silk Road require dedicated study with a variety of disciplines to understand their deterioration problems and appropriate methods of prevention.

With Giovanni Bellini, renowned art historian Oskar B?tschmann charts the fraught trajectory of Bellini\u2019s career, highlighting the crucial works that established his far-reaching influence in the Renaissance.The artist struggled to break out of the long shadow cast by his accomplished father Jacopo and father-in-law Andrea Mantegna, and B?tschmann chronicles Bellini\u2019s development of distinct aesthetic and painting techniques that enabled him to set himself apart. Bellini also insisted on choosing his own subjects and themes, independent of the preferences of his patron Isabella d\u2019Este, and thus set new standards for the role of the artist.Anchoring the analysis are a wealth of vibrant color reproductions that include such famous works as The Feast of the Gods and Madonna and Child, as well as photographs of Bellini\u2019s lauded altar-pieces at the churches of San Giobbe, Murano, and San Zaccania. Drawing on these masterpieces, B?tschmann argues that Bellini\u2019s artistry and skillful blending of colors created a new aesthetic more akin to music than to previous approaches to painting. And by leading viewers to understand this subtle, refined sensibility, Bellini transformed them into knowledgeable admirers of art.A lushly illustrated and expansive study, Giovanni Bellini is essential for all historians and admirers of Renaissance art.

From the flying buttresses and soaring vaults of the Gothic cathedral, to Michelangelo's powerfully rendered frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, to the great bronze baptistery doors in Florence, to Marc Chagall's majestic tapestries for the Knesset in Jerusalem, biblical stories and Christian themes form an integral part in our artistic heritage. But today, a lack of knowledge of the Bible and of Christian doctrine, as well as of church history and of ritual, frequently prevents us from understanding--and appreciating--much of the greatest art that has ever been created.     Exquisitely designed and lavishly illustrated--with over 200 pictures, including 16 color plates--The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture offers a goldmine of information on the Judeo-Christian tradition as it applies to Western art. Here are over 1700 alphabetical entries that cover everything from Adam and Eve and the Good Samaritan, to Illuminated Books and Rose Windows, to the great popes and emperors who patronized the arts, to the major artists whose work reflects Judeo-Christian themes. Indeed, readers will find entries on virtually every aspect of the topic: detailed essays on periods and styles in art and architecture, from the Byzantine and the Coptic, to the Gothic, the Romanesque, and the Renaissance; biographical entries on major artists (Giotto, Fra Angelico, Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, Titian, Rubens, and many more), on saints, popes, and patrons (including Saints Peter, Paul, Jerome, and Sebastian, Popes Urban VIII and Clement VII, and Emperors Charlemagne and Constantine) and on major biblical figures (such as Moses and Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Salome and Bathsheba); and briefer entries on icons and symbols (rainbow, dove, the Wheel of Fortune); on art forms influenced by Christian ideas (stained glass, mosaics, frescoes, altarpieces, and rose windows); and on general beliefs (the liturgical year, colors, vessels, Holy Week, and much more). And throughout the book, the Murrays continually interconnect the religious and the artistic. When discussing Moses, for instance, after providing an engaging account of his life, they examine the many works of art that feature Moses (they even explain why Michelangelo's Moses depicts him with \"horns\" on his head). Likewise, in the entry on Rembrandt (whom the Murrays call \"the greatest religious painter in the Protestant tradition\"), the authors focus on Rembrandt's religious works and describe how they reflect Protestant views (haloes are extremely rare, for instance, and \"Catholic\" subjects such as martyrdom are completely absent). Finally, the authors provide an informative glossary of architectural terms, and conclude with an extensive bibliography based on the Murrays' own personal library of art books.    Attractively illustrated, wide ranging, and informative, The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture is a unique resource on a major aspect of Western art. It is an essential work for museum-goers and for all lovers of fine painting, sculpture, and architecture.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "1996", "edition": "First edition.", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "612", "ISBN10": "0198661657", "ISBN13": "9780198661658", "file": "PDF, 17.85 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1165637", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1165637/858ef6"},

It focuses primarily on the Nubian response to the traditional pharaonic, Hellenistic/Roman, Hellenizing, and hybrid elements of Ptolemaic and Roman Egyptian culture.  The author begins with a history of Nubian art and a critical survey of the literature on Ptolemaic and Roman Egyptian art. Special chapters are then devoted to the discussion of the Egyptian-Greek interaction in the arts of Ptolemaic Egypt, the place of Egyptian Hellenistic and Hellenizing art within the oikumene, the pluralistic visual world of Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, as well as on the specific genre of terracotta sculpture. Utilizing examples from Meroe City and Musawwarat es Sufra, the author argues that cultural transfer from Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt to Nubia resulted in an inward-focused adaptation. Therefore, the resulting Nubian art from this period expresses only those aspects of Egyptian and Greek art that are compatible with indigenous Nubian goals.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2011", "publisher": "BRILL", "language": "english", "pages": "511", "ISBN10": "9004211284", "ISBN13": "9789004211285", "file": "PDF, 18.98 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1215997", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1215997/bf372b"},

The multilingual, culturally fluid Qing emperors put an extraordinary range of visual styles into practice--Chinese, Tibetan, Nepalese, and even the European Baroque brought to the court by Jesuit artists. Their pictorial, sculptural, and architectural projects escape easy analysis and raise questions about the difference between verbal and pictorial description, the ways in which overt and covert meaning could be embedded in images through juxtaposition and collage, and the collection and criticism of paintings and calligraphy that were intended as supports for practice and not initially as works of art.    \"All scholars of the Qianlong era, of early modern Mongol studies, of Tibetan Buddhism, and of pre-modern China studies will find the book indispensable.\" --- Pamela Crossley, Dartmouth College    \"More than any other art historical study to appear recently, this book expands our view of the visual culture of late imperial China by highlighting its ethnic complexity.\" --- Marsha Haufler, University of Kansas", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2003", "publisher": "University of Hawaii Press", "language": "english", "pages": "267 / 294", "ISBN10": "0824825632", "ISBN13": "9780824825638", "file": "PDF, 6.06 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1086009", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1086009/38c2e9"},

The essays gathered in Kant After  Duchamp mount the most formidable case yet made for Duchamp's  importance, and what makes de Duve's achievement all the more unexpected  is that this is done by way of an intense engagement with the writings  of Duchamp's seeming opposite, the critic Clement Greenberg. A third  constant presence in these pages is Kant's Critique of Judgement,  which at once governs de Duve's understanding of Greenberg's \"formalism\"  and is itself brilliantly reinterpreted in the light of Duchamp's  readymades. De Duve has always been an independent thinker. Now he has  produced an indispensable book, a brilliant and learned \"archaeology\" of  Duchampian modernism that is also a highly original contribution to  philosophical aesthetics.\" -- Michael Fried, Herbert Boone Professor of  Humanities, The Johns Hopkins University    Kant after Duchamp brings together eight essays around a central  thesis with many implications for the history of avant-gardes. Although  Duchamp's readymades broke with all previously known styles, de Duve  observes that he made the logic of modernist art practice the subject  matter of his work, a shift in aesthetic judgment that replaced the  classical \"this is beautiful\" with \"this is art.\" De Duve employs this  shift (replacing the word \"beauty\" by the word \"art\") in a rereading of  Kant's Critique of Judgment that reveals the hidden links between the  radical experiments of Duchamp and the Dadaists and mainstream pictorial  modernism. Part I of the book revolves around Duchamp's famous/infamous  Fountain. Part II explores his passage from painting to the readymades,  from art in particular to art in general. Part III looks at the  aesthetic and ethical consequences of the replacement of \"beauty\" with  \"art\" in Kant's Third Critique. Finally, part IV attempts to reconstruct  an \"archaeology\" of modernism that paves the way for a renewed  understanding of our postmodern condition. The essays: Art Was a Proper  Name.

These uncommon sensory experiences are examples of synesthesia, when two or more senses cooperate in perception. Once dismissed as imagination or delusion, metaphor or drug-induced hallucination, the experience of synesthesia has now been documented by scans of synesthetes' brains that show \"crosstalk\" between areas of the brain that do not normally communicate. In The Hidden Sense, Cretien van Campen explores synesthesia from both artistic and scientific perspectives, looking at accounts of individual experiences, examples of synesthesia in visual art, music, and literature, and recent neurological research.    Van Campen reports that some studies define synesthesia as a brain impairment, a short circuit between two different areas. But synesthetes cannot imagine perceiving in any other way; many claim that synesthesia helps them in daily life. Van Campen investigates just what the function of synesthesia might be and what it might tell us about our own sensory perceptions. He examines the experiences of individual synesthetes\u2014from Patrick, who sees music as images and finds the most beautiful ones spring from the music of Prince, to the schoolgirl Sylvia, who is surprised to learn that not everyone sees the alphabet in colors as she does. And he finds suggestions of synesthesia in the work of Scriabin, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, Nabokov, Poe, and Baudelaire.    What is synesthesia? It is not, van Campen concludes, an audiovisual performance, a literary technique, an artistic trend, or a metaphor. It is, perhaps, our hidden sense\u2014a way to think visually; a key to our own sensitivity.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2007", "edition": "1", "publisher": "The MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "197", "ISBN10": "0262514079", "ISBN13": "9780262514071", "file": "PDF, 1.04 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1263152", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1263152/40afc2"},

Nearly six hundred years ago, a short, genial, cannily alert man in his late thirties took a very old manuscript off a library shelf, saw with excitement what he had discovered, and ordered that it be copied. That book was the last surviving manuscript of an ancient Roman philosophical epic, On the Nature of Things, by Lucretius\u2014a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functioned without the aid of gods, that religious fear was damaging to human life, and that matter was made up of very small particles in eternal motion, colliding and swerving in new directions.     The copying and translation of this ancient book-the greatest discovery of the greatest book-hunter of his age-fueled the Renaissance, inspiring artists such as Botticelli and thinkers such as Giordano Bruno; shaped the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson. 16 pages full-color illustrations", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2011", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "W.

But they also elicited vehement criticism when first shown, described as against-the-grain, anticlassical\u2014even ugly and unpleasant. However, Rembrandt chose conventional subjects, kept close to time-honored pictorial schemes, and was well aware of the high prestige accorded to the depiction of the naked female body. Why, then, do these works deviate so radically from the depictions of nude women by other artists? To answer this question Eric Jan Sluijter, in Rembrandt and the Female Nude, examines Rembrandt\u2019s paintings and etchings against the background of established pictorial traditions in the Netherlands and Italy. Exploring Rembrandt\u2019s intense dialogue with the works of predecessors and peers, Sluijter demonstrates that, more than any other artist, Rembrandt set out to incite the greatest possible empathy in the viewer, an approach that had far-reaching consequences for the moral and erotic implications of the subjects Rembrandt chose to depict. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this richly illustrated study, Sluijter presents an innovative approach to Rembrandt\u2019s views on the art of painting, his attitude towards antiquity and Italian art of the Renaissance, his sustained rivalry with the works of other artists, his handling of the moral and erotic issues inherent in subjects with female nudes, and the nature of his artistic choices.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2007", "language": "english", "pages": "448 / 320", "ISBN10": "9053568379", "ISBN13": "9789053568378", "file": "PDF, 7.89 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/985791", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/985791/5664c1"},

Around the world, the champions of this form of expression are numerous, ranging from art historians such as Grant Kester, curators such as Nicolas Bourriaud and Nato Thompson, to performance theorists such as Shannon Jackson. Artificial Hells is the first historical and theoretical overview of socially engaged participatory art, known in the US as \u201csocial practice.\u201d Claire Bishop follows the trajectory of twentieth-century art and examines key moments in the development of a participatory aesthetic. This itinerary takes in Futurism and Dada; the Situationist International; Happenings in Eastern Europe, Argentina and Paris; the 1970s Community Arts Movement; and the Artists Placement Group. It concludes with a discussion of long-term educational projects by contemporary artists such as Thomas Hirschhorn, Tania Bruguera, Pawe\u0142 Althamer and Paul Chan.Since her controversial essay in Artforum in 2006, Claire Bishop has been one of the few to challenge the political and aesthetic ambitions of participatory art. In Artificial Hells, she not only scrutinizes the emancipatory claims made for these projects, but also provides an alternative to the ethical (rather than artistic) criteria invited by such artworks. Artificial Hells calls for a less prescriptive approach to art and politics, and for more compelling, troubling and bolder forms of participatory art and criticism. 86 B&W illustrations", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2012", "edition": "Original", "publisher": "Verso", "language": "english", "pages": "390 / 386", "ISBN10": "1844676900", "ISBN13": "9781844676903", "file": "PDF, 6.68 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2030125", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2030125/5e7ba5"},

We call it the Renaissance, a rebirth of ancient art and learning.' \rThis story begins in the waning days of the 14th century, and tells the story of the competition between Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi to design and produce a new set of bronze doors for the Church of St John the Baptist (The Baptistery) in Florence.  Ghiberti won this particular competition, but was largely eclipsed by Brunelleschi who went on to become the architect of the dome of Florence's cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore. \rMr Walker describes the competition between the two as personal and hence as a feud.  I see it more as a conflict of ideas rather than purely as a personal feud.  Brunelleschi is credited with inventing perspective and used this in his design of the dome.  It was this modern approach to engineering that enabled Santa Maria del Fiore to be crowned with a dome of such magnificence and beauty that it has become one of the most enduring symbols of the Renaissance.  It seems that Ghiberti, by contrast, created his beautiful work by drawing on the past. \rI'm not entirely comfortable with Mr Walker's view of Brunelleschi and Ghiberti as sparking the Renaissance, attractive as it is to think of an artist and an architect ushering in this new age.  I prefer to see the  Bapistery doors and the Dome symbols of the Renaissance, rather than the catalyst for it.    \rI enjoyed reading this book: it added to my understanding of Florence during this period. \rJennifer Cameron-Smith", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2002", "publisher": "William Morrow", "language": "english", "pages": "159", "ISBN10": "0641847149", "ISBN13": "9780380807925", "file": "PDF, 2.23 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/683674", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/683674/e84919"},

Now revised, expanded, and completely redesigned with 75 never-before-published drawings from the Hogarth archives and 24 pages of new material, this award-winning reference explores  the expressive structure of the human form from the artist\u2019s point of view.The 400 remarkable illustrations explain the anatomical details of male and female figures in motion and at rest, always stressing the human form in space. Meticulous diagrams and fascinating action studies examine the rhythmic relationship of muscles and their effect upon surface forms. The captivating text is further enhanced by the magnificent figure drawings of such masters as Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Rodin, Picasso, and other great artists.Dynamic Anatomy presents a comprehensive, detailed study of the human figure as artistic anatomy.

These and other wild schemes were part of the repertoire of showmen who traveled from city to city, making presentations that blended science with myth and magic.In Wonder Shows, Fred Nadis offers a colorful history of these traveling magicians, inventors, popular science lecturers, and other presenters of \"miracle science\" who revealed science and technology to the public in awe-inspiring fashion. The book provides an innovative synthesis of the history of performance with a wider study of culture, science, and religion from the antebellum period to the present. It features a lively cast of characters, including electrical \"wizards\" Nikola Tesla and Thomas Alva Edison, vaudeville performers such as Harry Houdini, mind readers, UFO cultists, and practitioners of New Age science. All of these performers developed strategies for invoking cultural authority to back their visions of science and progress. The pseudo-science in their wonder shows helped promote a romantic worldview that called into question the absolute authority of scientific materialism while reaffirming the importance of human spirituality. Nadis argues that the sensation that these entertainers provided became an antidote to the alienation and dehumanization that accompanied the rise of modern America. Although most recent defenders of science are prone to reject wonder, considering it an ally of ignorance and superstition, Wonder Shows demonstrates that the public\u2019s passion for magic and meaning is still very much alive. Today, sales continue to be made and allegiances won based on illusions that products are unique, singular, and at best, miraculous.

But without narrative direction of the sort found in novels and travelogues, theatregoers were left to their own interpretive devices, making imperial drama both a powerful and yet uncertain site for the transmission of official imperial ideologies. Nineteenth-century playwrights fed the public\u2019s interest in Britain\u2019s Empire by producing a wide variety of plays set in colonial locales: India, Australia, and\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014Africa. These plays recreated the battles that consolidated Britain\u2019s hold on overseas territories, dramatically depicted western humanitarian intervention in indigenous cultural practices, celebrated images of imperial supremacy, and occasionally criticized the sexual and material excesses that accompanied the processes of empire-building. An active participant in the real-world drama of empire, the Victorian theatre produced popular images that reflected, interrogated, and reinforced imperial policy. Indeed, it was largely through plays and spectacles that the British public vicariously encountered the sights and sounds of the distant imperial periphery. Empire as it was seen on stage was empire as it was popularly known: the repetitions of character types, plot scenarios, and thematic concerns helped forge an idea of empire that, though largely imaginary, entertained, informed, and molded the theatre-going British public.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2011", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Routledge", "language": "english", "pages": "273", "ISBN10": "0415889847", "ISBN13": "9780203819067", "file": "PDF, 2.63 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1161114", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1161114/f367cd"},

This is a work of historical materialist theater scholarship, which combines a materialism grounded in a socialist tradition of cultural studies with some of the insights developed in recent years by theorists of affect, and addresses some fundamental questions about the social function and political potential of theater within modern capitalism. Passionate Amateurs argues that theater in modern capitalism can help us think afresh about notions of work, time, and freedom. Its title concept is a theoretical and historical figure, someone whose work in theater is undertaken within capitalism, but motivated by a love that desires something different. In addition to its theoretical originality, it offers a significant new reading of a major Chekhov play, the most sustained scholarly engagement to date with Benjamin\u2019s \u201cProgram for a Proletarian Children\u2019s Theatre,\u201d the first major consideration of Godard\u2019s La chinoise as a \u201ctheatrical\u201d work, and the first chapter-length discussion of the work of The Nature Theatre of Oklahoma, an American company rapidly gaining a profile in the European theater scene.

Over the same number of years, scholarly interest in the relationship of consciousness to theatre has equally grown.\u00a0The book discusses a range of questions relevant to understanding the phenomenon of theatre against a consciousness studies background. Those questions include:\u2022 What inspires the dramatist to write a play? This question addresses the nature of the creative process. \u2022 How do different plays reflect human consciousness? \u2022 What kinds of new ideas did major directors or theatre makers, such as Artaud, Grotowski, Barba, and Brook introduce? \u2022 Should actors be personally involved with the emotions they have to portray? \u2022 Are puppets or marionettes superior to actors? \u2022 How to account for the designer\u2019s combination of creativity and practical skill? What part does mental imagination play in the design process? How do designers get their own spatial awareness across to their spectators? \u2022 How does theatre affect the spectator?

Art, since the Impressionist period, has seemingly moved in the opposite direction, toward a less realistic interpretation of the world around us.  Edward S. Casey demonstrates that the disciplines of mapping and painting, long thought to have diverged, are again intersecting. Earth-Mapping describes the ways in which artists of the last half century have incorporated ingenious mapping techniques into their art works.  Beginning with a reassessment of the pioneering earth art of Robert Smithson in the 1960s and 1970s, Casey follows Smithson's legacy in the works of Sandy Gellis, Margot McLean, and Michelle Stuart.  He also explores the visions of the earth found in the abstract paintings of Richard Diebenkorn, Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Eve Ingalls, and Dan Rice.  Focusing on forms of mapping that depart radically from conventional cartography - particularly \"mapping with/in,\" being with or in a place, and \"mapping out,\" communicating that experience of connection with others Casey - shows how earth art and abstract painting respectively reshape our landscape and our view of it, drawing us in from our bird's-eye view of the grid of highways and roads.  In these works, we come to see the earth as it is sensed, remembered, and reshaped by artists as they explore the effect of the landscape on humans and the human effect on the landscape, and as they demand a response to the changing world around us.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2005", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Univ Of Minnesota Press", "language": "english", "pages": "284", "ISBN10": "0816643326", "ISBN13": "9780816695850", "file": "PDF, 20.92 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1068742", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1068742/1833cf"},

This book is a window into Hirst's world: growing up in working class northern England, roughhousing in pubs, obsessing about life and death, questioning art world fame, and believing that art and beauty make a difference in the modern world.In addition to the attention he generates, this dynamic artist also garners critical acclaim-he is the winner of the Turner Prize and, ever since the groundbreaking exhibition that he organized as a fledgling artist in the early nineties, he is considered the unofficial leader of the Young British Artists movement.

Beyond  these artistic considerations, however, lies a larger story: a theatre  that has resonated with the intense concerns of its audiences acquires  a significance and a force beyond anything created by striking  individual talents or random stage hits. Amid the variety of  performances during the past hundred years, that basic and provocative  reality has been repeatedly demonstrated, as Jarka Burian reveals in  his extraordinary history of the dramatic world of Czech theatre.    Following a brief historical background, Burian provides a  chronological series of perspectives and observations on the evolving  nature of Czech theatre productions during this century in relation to  their similarly evolving social and political contexts. Once  Czecho-slovak independence was achieved in 1918, a repeated interplay  of theatre with political realities became the norm, sometimes  stifling the creative urge but often producing even greater  artistry. When playwright Vaclav Havel became president in 1990, this  was but the latest and most celebrated example of the vital engagement  between stage and society that has been a repeated condition of Czech  theatre for the past two hundred years.    Underlying all questions of the Czech theatre's relevance to its  audience is the historically and culturally shaped relationship  between the two. In Jarka Burian's skillful hands, it also becomes an  extremely important touchstone for understanding the history of modern  theatre within western culture.", "categories": "Arts - Performing Arts", "year": "2000", "publisher": "University of Iowa Press", "language": "english", "pages": "285", "ISBN10": "0877457220", "ISBN13": "9780877457114", "file": "PDF, 4.90 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1226187", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1226187/11dc16"},

This approach receives sharp challenge in Jill Burke's Changing Patrons, a book that draws heavily upon the author's discoveries in Florentine archives, tracing the many profound transformations in patrons' relations to the visual world of fifteenth-century Florence. Looking closely at two of the city's upwardly mobile families, Burke demonstrates that they approached the visual arts from within a grid of social, political, and religious concerns. Art for them often served as a mediator of social difference and a potent means of signifying status and identity. Changing Patrons combines visual analysis with techniques from history and anthropology to propose new interpretations of the art created by, among others, Botticelli, Filippino Lippi, and Raphael.

We see Leonardo, having just completed The Last Supper, and being celebrated by all of Florence for his miraculous portrait of the wife of a textile manufacturer. That painting\u2014the Mona Lisa\u2014being called the most lifelike anyone had ever seen yet, more divine than human, was captivating the entire Florentine Republic.And Michelangelo, completing a commissioned statue of David, the first colossus of the Renaissance, the archetype hero for the Republic epitomizing the triumph of the weak over the strong, helping to reshape the public identity of the city of Florence and conquer its heart.In The Lost Battles, published in England to great acclaim (\u201cSuperb\u201d\u2014The Observer; \u201cBeguilingly written\u201d\u2014The Guardian), Jonathan Jones brilliantly sets the scene of the time\u2014the politics; the world of art and artisans; and the shifting, agitated cultural landscape. We see Florence, a city freed from the oppressive reach of the Medicis, lurching from one crisis to another, trying to protect its liberty in an Italy descending into chaos, with the new head of the Republic in search of a metaphor that will make clear the glory that is Florence, and seeing in the commissioned paintings the expression of his vision.Jones reconstructs the paintings that Leonardo and Michelangelo undertook\u2014Leonardo\u2019s Battle of Anghiari, a nightmare seen in the eyes of the warrior (it became the first modern depiction of the disenchantment of war) and Michelangelo\u2019s Battle of Cascina, a call to arms and the first great transfiguration of the erotic into art. Jones writes about the competition; how it unfolded and became the defining moment in the transformation of \u201ccraftsman\u201d to \u201cartist\u201d; why the Florentine government began to fall out of love with one artist in favor of the other; and how\u2014and why\u2014in a competition that had no formal prize to clearly resolve the outcome, the battle became one for the hearts and minds of the Florentine Republic, with Michelangelo setting out to prove that his work, not Leonardo\u2019s, embodied the future of art. Finally, we see how the result of the competition went on to shape a generation of narrative paintings, beginning with those of Raphael. A riveting exploration into one of history\u2019s most resonant exchanges of ideas, a rich, fascinating book that gives us a whole new understanding of an age and those at its center.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2012", "publisher": "Knopf", "language": "english", "pages": "368", "ISBN10": "0307594750", "ISBN13": "9780307594754", "file": "EPUB, 12.98 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1312930/7803aa"},

He skillfully interweaves the great works-by Dostoevsky, Stravinsky, and Chagall-with folk embroidery, peasant songs, religious icons, and all the customs of daily life, from food and drink to bathing habits to beliefs about the spirit world. Figes's characters range high and low: the revered Tolstoy, who left his deathbed to search for the Kingdom of God, as well as the serf girl Praskovya, who became Russian opera's first superstar and shocked society by becoming her owner's wife. Like the European-schooled countess Natasha performing an impromptu folk dance in Tolstoy's War and Peace, the spirit of \"Russianness\" is revealed by Figes as rich and uplifting, complex and contradictory-a powerful force that unified a vast country and proved more lasting than any Russian ruler or state.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2002", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Metropolitan Books", "language": "english", "pages": "544 / 773", "ISBN10": "0312421958", "ISBN13": "9780312421953", "file": "PDF, 12.26 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/"},

For use with a formal programme of study, from masters to doctoral level, the book derives from the creative relationship between research, practice and teaching in art and design. It extends generic research processes into practice-based approaches more relevant to artists and designers, introducing wherever possible visual, interactive and collaborative methods. The Introduction and Chapter 1 'Planning the Journey' define the concept and value of 'practice-based' formal research, tracking the debate around its development and explaining key concepts and terminology. 'Mapping the Terrain' then describes methods of contextualizing research in art and design (the contextual review, using reference material); 'Locating Your Position' and 'Crossing the Terrain' guide the reader through the stages of identifying an appropriate research question and methodological approach, writing the proposal and managing research information.  Methods of evaluation and analysis are explored, and finally strategies for reporting and communicating research findings are suggested. Appendices and a glossary are also included. Visualizing Research draws on the experience of researchers in different contexts and includes case studies of real projects. Although written primarily for postgraduate students, research supervisors, managers and academic staff in art and design and related areas, such as architecture and media studies, will find this a valuable research reference.

Berger\u2019s insights make it impossible to look at a painting, watch a film, or even visit a zoo in quite the same way again. The vast range of subjects he addresses, the lean beauty of his prose, and the keenness of his anger against injustice move us to view the world with a new lens of awareness. Whether he is discussing the singleminded intensity of Picasso\u2019s Guernica, the parallel violence and alienation in the art of Francis Bacon and Walt Disney, or the enigmatic silence of his own mother, what binds these pieces throughout is the depth and fury of Berger\u2019s passion, challenging us to participate, to protest, and above all, to see.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2003", "publisher": "Vintage", "language": "english", "pages": "608", "ISBN10": "0375713182", "ISBN13": "9780375713187", "file": "MOBI , 1.11 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2208709/4dd2da"},

This does not mean key thinkers in this period were of one or similar stripe.  They held different, and sometimes diametrical, views.

This collection of essays by art historians                  from Europe and the Americas introduces and develops the idea that conceptual art                  generated several different, and even contradictory, forms of art practice. Some of                  these contested commonplace assumptions of what art is; others served to buttress                  those assumptions. The bulk of the volume features newly written and highly                  innovative essays challenging standard interpretations of the legacy of                  conceptualism and discussing the influence of conceptualism's varied practices on                  art since the 1970s. The essays explore topics as diverse as the interrelationships                  between conceptualism and institutional critique, neoexpressionist painting and                  conceptualist paradigms, conceptual art's often-ignored complicity with design and                  commodity culture, the specific forms of identity politics taken up by the reception                  of conceptual art, and conceptualism's North/South and East/West dynamics. A few                  texts that continue to be crucial for critical debates within the fields of                  conceptual and postconceptual art practice, history, and theory have been reprinted                  in order to convey the vibrant and ongoing discussion on the status of art after                  conceptual art. Taken together, the essays will inspire an exploration of the                  relationship between postconceptualist practices and the beginnings of contemporary                  art.Distributed for the Generali Foundation, Vienna", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2006", "publisher": "The MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "240 / 116", "ISBN10": "0262511959", "ISBN13": "9780262511957", "file": "PDF, 19.93 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1254348", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1254348/7d776f"},

As well as writings by artists, the anthology includes texts by critics, philosophers, politicians and literary figures. The content is clearly structured into eight broadly chronological sections, starting with the legacy of symbolism and concluding with contemporary debates about the postmodern. The editors provide individual introductions to each of the 340 anthologized texts. Material new to this expanded edition includes texts on African art, on the Bauhaus and on the re-emergent avant-gardes of the period after the Second World War.

In                  this book -- part intellectual biography, part institutional history -- Sybil Gordon                  Kantor tells the story of the rise of modern art in America and of the man                  responsible for its triumph. Following the trajectory of Barr's career from the                  1920s through the 1940s, Kantor penetrates the myths, both positive and negative,                  that surround Barr and his achievements.Barr fervently believed in an aesthetic                  based on the intrinsic traits of a work of art and the materials and techniques                  involved in its creation. Kantor shows how this formalist approach was expressed in                  the organizational structure of the multidepartmental museum itself, whose                  collections, exhibitions, and publications all expressed Barr's vision. At the same                  time, she shows how Barr's ability to reconcile classical objectivity and mythic                  irrationality allowed him to perceive modernism as an open-ended phenomenon that                  expanded beyond purist abstract modernism to include surrealist, nationalist,                  realist, and expressionist art.Drawing on interviews with Barr's contemporaries as                  well as on Barr's extensive correspondence, Kantor also paints vivid portraits of,                  among others, Jere Abbott, Katherine Dreier, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, Philip                  Johnson, Lincoln Kirstein, Agnes Mongan, J.

Clarke investigates a rich assortment of Roman erotic art to answer this question-and along the way, he reveals a society quite different from our own. Clarke reevaluates our understanding of Roman art and society in a study informed by recent gender and cultural studies, and focusing for the first time on attitudes toward the erotic among both the Roman non-elite and women. This splendid volume is the first study of erotic art and sexuality to set these works-many newly discovered and previously unpublished-in their ancient context and the first to define the differences between modern and ancient concepts of sexuality using clear visual evidence.    Roman artists pictured a great range of human sexual activities-far beyond those mentioned in classical literature-including sex between men and women, men and men, women and women, men and boys, threesomes, foursomes, and more. Roman citizens paid artists to decorate expensive objects, such as silver and cameo glass, with scenes of lovemaking. Erotic works were created for and sold to a broad range of consumers, from the elite to the very poor, during a period spanning the first century B.C. through the mid-third century of our era. This erotic art was not hidden away, but was displayed proudly in homes as signs of wealth and luxury. In public spaces, artists often depicted outrageous sexual acrobatics to make people laugh.    Looking at Lovemaking depicts a sophisticated, pre-Christian society that placed a high value on sexual pleasure and the art that represented it. Clarke shows how this culture evolved within religious, social, and legal frameworks that were vastly different from our own and contributes an original and controversial chapter to the history of human sexuality.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "1998", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0520200241", "ISBN13": "9780585327136", "file": "EPUB, 7.82 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1066598/b1987d"},

The theories of art developed under the name of 'aesthetics' in the eighteenth century have traditionally been understood as contributions to a field of study in existence since the time of Plato. If art is a practice to be found in all human societies, then the philosophy of art is the search for universal features of that practice, which can be stated in definitions of art and beauty. However, art as we know it - the system of 'fine arts' - is largely peculiar to modern society. Aesthetics, far from being a perennial discipline, emerged in an effort both to understand and to shape this new social practice. These essays share the conviction that aesthetic ideas can be fully understood when seen not only in relation to intellectual and social contexts, but as themselves constructed in history.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2008", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "267", "ISBN10": "0521431069", "ISBN13": "9780521431064", "file": "PDF, 10.43 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1258349", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1258349/78ee45"},

Centered on a highly publicized yet famously inconclusive 1982 meeting between Beuys and the Dalai Lama, arranged by the Dutch artist Louwrien Wijers, Chris Thompson explores the interconnections among Beuys, the Fluxus movement, and Eastern philosophy and spiritual practice.\n\r\nBuilding from the resonance of felt, the fabric, in both Tibetan culture and in Beuys\u2019s art, Thompson takes as his point of departure Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s discussion in A Thousand Plateaus of felt as smooth space that is \u201cin principle infinite, open, and unlimited in every direction,\u201d its structure determined by chance as opposed to the planned, woven nature of most fabrics. Felt is thus seen as an alternative to the model of the network: felt\u2019s anarchic form is not reducible to the regularity of the net, grid, or mesh, and the more it is pulled, tweaked, torn, and agitated, the greater its structural integrity.\n\r\nFelt thus invents its methodology from the material that represents its object of inquiry and from this advances a reading of the avant-garde. At the same time, Thompson demonstrates that it is sometimes the failures of thought, the disappointing meetings, even the untimely deaths that open portals through which life flows into art and allows new conjunctions of life, art, and thought. Thompson explores both the well-known engagement of Fluxus artists with Eastern spirituality and the more elusive nature of Beuys\u2019s own late interest in Tibetan culture, arriving at a sense of how such noncausal interactions\u2014interhuman intrigue\u2014create culture and shape contemporary art history.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2011", "publisher": "University of Minnesota Press", "language": "english", "pages": "320", "ISBN10": "0816653542", "file": "EPUB, 3.20 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2089261/f17935"},

But this dream is also                  an individual appropriation of a collective Soviet project and the official Soviet                  propaganda connected to it. Having built a makeshift slingshot, the hero apparently                  flies through the ceiling of his shabby room and vanishes into space. The miserable                  room and the primitive slingshot suggest the reality behind the Soviet utopia, in                  which where cosmic vision and the political project of the Communist revolution are                  seen as indissoluble.The Man who Flew into Space from His Apartment also raises                  questions of authorship in modernity. All of Kabakov's work is made in the name of                  other, fictitious artists.

A journal anthology draws a collective portrait; together, the gathered texts demonstrate the journal's ambitions and strengths. From the outset, October's aim has been to consider a range of cultural practices and to assess their place at a particular historical juncture. That task has now taken on an intensified urgency. The catastrophic state of our urban economies and the attendant social crises, as well as the more general predicaments of a postcolonial era, have had an inescapable impact on the cultural and discursive practices that are October's concern. Hence, October in its second decade has had an intensified concern with the role of cultural production within the public sphere and a sharper focus on the intersections of cultural practices with institutional structures. The topics of inquiry include body politics and psychoanalysis, spectacle and institutional critique, art practice and art history, and postcolonial discourse.

Under the leadership of the renowned soldier-statesman Perikles, Athenians began rebuilding the Akropolis, where they created the still awe-inspiring Parthenon. Athenians also reached a zenith of artistic achievement in sculpture, vase painting, and architecture, which provided continuing inspiration for many succeeding generations.   The specially commissioned essays in this volume offer a fresh, innovative panorama of the art, architecture, history, culture, and influence of Periklean Athens. Written by leading experts in the field, the articles cover a wide range of topics, including:  * An evaluation of Perikles' military leadership during the early stages of the Peloponnesian War.  * Iconographical and iconological studies of vase paintings, wall paintings, and sculpture.  * Explorations of the Parthenon and other monuments of the Athenian Akropolis.  *The legacy of Periklean Athens and its influence upon later art.  * Assessments of the modern reception of the Akropolis.

Questioning the authenticity of the 'Christ on the Mount Olives', Kitson refers not only to the style of the paintingand the lack of any  reference to it in 17th century sources, but also to 'the absence of copies...of a work by a painter so famous and so widely imitated.' The implication is that copies, which hitherto have not been considered with much  care or detail, might provide evidence as to the authenticity of paintings, and that this evidence might be comparable in reliability with that of literary sources.  This study by Moir is based on a survey, made over several years, of painted and drawn copies and of prints  after Caravaggio's  pictures. It consists of a text-essay and three appendices. In the essay, Moir has attempted to formulate answers to important questions about identifying Caravaggio's work, and to establish the principles underlying the practice and dissemination of copies after Caravaggio. Appendix I incorporates the raw findings of the survey of the copies. In outline form, this appendix includes copies after both existent and lost works by Caravaggio. It is accompanied by extensive notes, including comments on the copies and on the originals, and presenting much correlative material.  Most of the illustrations have been chosen for simple documentary reasons, with preference for unpublished copies and variants, and for works demonstrating hitherto unrecognized relations.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "1976", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "New York University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "232", "ISBN10": "0814754082", "ISBN13": "9780814754085", "file": "PDF, 83.81 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1236208", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1236208/43ab02"},

Bowd"], "rating": "0", "description": "The love of making things need not be confined to the physical world \u2014electronic form giving can also be a rewarding hands-on experience. In this investigation of the possibility of craft in the digital realm, Malcolm McCullough observes that the emergence of computation as a medium, rather than just a set of tools, suggests a growing correspondence between digital work and traditional craft.    Personal and conversational in tone, with examples and illustrations drawn from a variety of disciplines, Abstracting Craft shows that anyone who gives form with software, whether in architecture, painting, animating, modeling, simulating, or manufacturing, is practicing personal knowledge and producing visual artifacts that, although not material, are nevertheless products of the hands, eyes, and mind.    Chapter by chapter, McCullough builds a case for upholding humane traits and values during the formative stages of new practices in digital media. He covers the nature of hand-eye coordination; the working context of the image culture; aspects of tool usage and medium appreciation; uses and limitations of symbolic methods; issues in human-computer interaction; geometric constructions and abstract methods in design; the necessity of improvisation; and the personal worth of work.    For those new to computing, McCullough offers an inside view of what the technology is like, what the important technical issues are, and how creative computing fits within a larger intellectual history. Specialists in human-computer interaction will find an interesting case study of the anthropological and psychological issues that matter to designers. Artificial intelligence researchers will be reminded that much activity fails to fit articulable formalisms. Aesthetic theorists will find a curiously developed case of neostructuralism, and cultural critics will be asked to imagine a praxis in which technology no longer represents an authoritarian opposition. Finally, the unheralded legions of digital craftspersons will find a full-blown acknowledgment of their artistry and humanity.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "1996", "publisher": "MIT Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0262133261", "ISBN13": "9780262133265", "file": "EPUB, 1.10 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1176272/62638e"},

In a flash of inspiration, she picked up her scissors and cut out a paper replica of the petal, inventing the art of collage. It was the summer of 1772, in England. During the next ten years she completed nearly a thousand cut-paper botanicals (which she called mosaicks) so accurate that botanists still refer to them. Poet-biographer Molly Peacock uses close-ups of these brilliant collages in The Paper Garden to track the extraordinary life of Delany, friend of Swift, Handel, Hogarth, and even Queen Charlotte and King George III.How did this remarkable role model for late blooming manage it? After a disastrous teenage marriage to a drunken sixty-one-year-old squire, she took control of her own life, pursuing creative projects, spurning suitors, and gaining friends. At forty-three, she married Jonathan Swift's friend Dr. Patrick Delany, and lived in Ireland in a true expression of midlife love. But after twenty-five years and a terrible lawsuit, her husband died. Sent into a netherland of mourning, Mrs. Delany was rescued by her friend, the fabulously wealthy Duchess of Portland. The Duchess introduced Delany to the botanical adventurers of the day and a bonanza of exotic plants from Captain Cook's voyage, which became the inspiration for her art. Peacock herself first saw Mrs. Delany's work more than twenty years before she wrote The Paper Garden, but \"like a book you know is too old for you,\" she put the thought of the old woman away. She went on to marry and cherish the happiness of her own midlife, in a parallel to Mrs. Delany, and by chance rediscovered the mosaicks decades later. This encounter confronted the poet with her own aging and gave her-and her readers-a blueprint for late-life flexibility, creativity, and change.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Bloomsbury USA", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "1608195236", "ISBN13": "9781608195237", "file": "EPUB, 3.08 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1210879/feb683"},

It is one of the most fascinating, and enduring, art forms in Western culture.John Manning's book charts the rise and evolution of the emblem from its earliest manifestations to its emergence as a genre in its own right in the sixteenth century, and then through its various reinventions to the present day. The seventeenth century saw the development of new emblematic forms and sub-genres, and the sharpening of the form for the purpose of social satire. When the Jesuits appropriated the emblem, producing enormous quantities of material, a further dimension of moral seriousness was introduced, alongside a concentration of emblematic \"wit\". The emblem later came to be directed increasingly at young people and children; in particular, William Blake adopted a fresh attitude towards ideas of the child and childishness.

Terms such as culture and identity are not static ideas, but constructions of a particular social milieu at any given point in time. Roman citizenship functioned as a kind of ideological apparatus that, when given to a non-Roman, questioned that individual's native identity. Beginning from the hypothesis that the possession of Roman citizenship provides solid evidence that a person has at least some ideological interest in Rome, the theoretical bases of Louis Althusser and Pierre Bourdieu are used as guides in an analysis of four sources: Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Paul of Tarsus, the jurist Ulpian, and civic coins minted in the Greek east. These sources answer the question 'What is a Roman?' in different \u2013 and often conflicting - ways, in turn showing that modern terms such as \u2018Romanization\u2019 gloss over all of the diversity within, and plasticity of, the cultures of both the Romans and those people whom they \u2018conquered\u2019", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2008", "publisher": "VDM Verlag Dr. Mu\u0308ller", "language": "english", "pages": "116", "ISBN10": "3639073436", "ISBN13": "9783639073430", "file": "PDF, 2.83 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2036119", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2036119/dbecef"},

Whitney Davis now provides a welcome remedy in   this   detailed reinterpretation of the images carved on ivory knife handles   and schist   cosmetic palettes. These images are among the most important documents   of early   Egyptian history and include the Narmer Palette, often considered the   very   inception of ancient Egyptian image making.  Davis deciphers the intriguing pictorial narratives and complex   metaphors of    images that are concerned with \"masking the blow\" of the ruler. \"Masking   the   blow\" refers to the ways that the imagesfrom hunted animals to human   antagonistsrepresent, elide, or suppress the depiction of a ruler's   violent act   of conquering an enemy.  Examining late prehistoric Egyptian images in light of contemporary   visual   theory and illustrating his analyses with excellent reproductions, Davis   goes   beyond the usual concern for stylistic development and iconographic   meanings   that characterize prior studies.

Now, in this enthralling new book, he tells the story of objects that are, to many, the pinnacle of the jeweler\u2019s art: the Faberg\u00e9 imperial eggs.\r\nThe Easter presents that Russia\u2019s last two czars gave to their czarinas have become synonymous with privilege, beauty, and an almost provocative uselessness. They are perhaps the most redolent symbols of the old empire\u2019s phenomenal craftsmanship, of the decadence of its court, and of the upheavals that brought about its inevitable downfall. Faberg\u00e9\u2019s Eggs is the first book to recount the remarkable story of these masterpieces, taking us from the circumstances that inspired each egg\u2019s design, through their disappearance in the trauma of revolution, to their eventual reemergence in the global marketplace.\r\nIn 1885, Carl Faberg\u00e9 created a seemingly plain white egg for Czar Alexander III to give to his beloved wife, Marie Fedorovna. It was the surprises hidden inside that made it special: a diamond miniature of the Imperial crown and a ruby pendant. This gift began a tradition that would last for more than three decades: lavishly extravagant eggs commemorating public events that, in retrospect, seem little more than staging posts on the march to revolution. Above all, the eggs illustrate the attitudes that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the Romanovs: their apparent indifference to the poverty that choked their country, their preference for style over substance, and, during the reign of Nicholas II, their all-consuming concern with the health of the czarevitch Alexis, the sickly heir to the throne\u2013a preoccupation that would propel them toward Rasputin and the doom of the dynasty.\r\nMore than a superb new account of a classic tragedy, Faberg\u00e9\u2019s Eggs illuminates some fascinating aspects of twentieth-century history. The eggs\u2019 amazing journey from revolutionary Russia features a cast of characters including embattled Bolsheviks, acquisitive British royals, eccentric artifact salesmen, and such famous business and society figures as Arm and Hammer, Marjorie Merriweather Post, and Malcolm Forbes. Finally, Toby Faber tantalizingly suggests that some of the eggs long thought lost may eventually emerge.\r\nDarting from the palaces of a besieged Russia to the showcases of New York\u2019s modern mega-wealthy, Faberg\u00e9\u2019s Eggs weaves a story unparalleled in its drama and extravagance.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2008", "publisher": "Random House", "language": "english", "pages": "320", "ISBN10": "140006550X", "ISBN13": "9781588367075", "file": "EPUB, 5.02 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2159535/56afd9"},

Therefore, it seems to us urgent to explore what the term research actually means in the topical practice of art. After all, research as such is often understood as a method stemming from the alpha, beta or gamma sciences directed towards knowledge production and the development of a certain scientific domain. How is artistic research connected with those types of scientific research, taking into account that the artistic domain so far has tended to continually exceed the parameters of knowledge management?    One could claim that the artistic field comprises the hermeneutic question of the humanities, the experimental method of the sciences, and the societal commitment of the social sciences. Will that knowledge influence the domain, the methodology, and the outcome of artistic research? Another major topic concerns not only the specificity of the object of knowledge of artistic research but above all whether and how artistic research and its institutional programs will influence topical visual art, its artworks and its exhibitions.    These complex problematics with their various points of view and management models are mapped out through the contributions of theorists, curators, and institutions, from Belgium, France, Great-Britain, Italy, The Netherlands, Finland, Germany, and Sweden.

During van Meegeren's heyday as a forger of Vermeers, he earned 50 million dollars, the acclamation of the world's press, and the satisfaction of swindling the Nazis. His canvases were so nearly authentic that they would almost certainly be prized among the catalogue of Vermeers if he had not confessed. And, no doubt, he never would have confessed at all if he hadn't been trapped in a catch-22: he had thrived so noticably during the war that when it ended, he was quickly arrested as a Nazi collaborator. His only defense was to admit that he himself had painted the remarkable \"Vermeers\" that had passed through his hands--a confession the public refused to believe, until, in a huge media event, the courts staged the public painting of what would be van Meegeren's last \"Vermeer.\" I Was Vermeer is an utterly gripping real-life mystery, capturing both the life of the consummate art forger, phenomenally skilled and yet necessarily unrecognized, and the equally fascinating work of the experts who identify forgeries and track down their perpetrators. Wry, amoral, irreverent, and plotted like a thriller, it is the first major book in forty years on this astonishing episode in history.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2006", "edition": "First Edition, First Printing.", "publisher": "Bloomsbury USA", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "1582345937", "ISBN13": "9781582345932", "file": "EPUB, 2.15 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1054701/d18db0"},

Fixed in place, it does not move about as artefacts as trade objects do. Enigmatic in its meaning, it uniquely offers a direct record of how prehistoric Europeans saw and envisioned their own worlds. European Landscapes of Rock-Art provides a number of case studies, covering arange of European locations including Ireland, Italy, Scandinavia, Scotland and Spain, which collectively address the chronology and geography of rock-art as well as providing an essential series of methodologies for future debate. Each author provides a synthesis that focuses on landscape as an essential part of rock-art construction. From the paintings and carved images of prehistoric Scandinavia to Second World War grafitti on the German Reichstag, this volume looks beyond the art to the society that made it. The papers in this volume also challenge the traditional views of how rock-art is recorded. Throughout, there is an emphasis on informal and informed methodologies. The authors skilfully discuss subjectivity and its relationship with landscape since personal experience, from prehistoric times to the present day, plays an essential role in the interpretation of art itself. The emphasis is on location, on the intentionality of the artist, and on the needs of the audience. This exciting volume is a crucial addition to rock-art literature and landscape archaeology. It will provide new material for a lively and greatly debated subject and as such will be essential for academics, non-academics and commentators of rock art in general.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2002", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Routledge", "language": "english", "pages": "240 / 237", "ISBN10": "0415257344", "ISBN13": "9780415257343", "file": "PDF, 6.80 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/850348", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/850348/6c2f2d"},

The netsuke are tiny and tactile--they sit in the palm of your hand--and de Waal is drawn to them as \"small, tough explosions of exactitude.\" He's also drawn to the story behind them, and for years he put aside his own work as a world-renowned potter and curator to uncover the rich and tragic family history of which the carvings are one of the few concrete legacies. De Waal's family was the Ephrussis, wealthy Jewish grain traders who branched out from Russia across the capitals of Europe before seeing their empire destroyed by the Nazis. Beginning with his art connoisseur ancestor Charles (a model for Proust's Swann), who acquired the netsuke during the European rage for Japonisme, de Waal traces the collection from Japan to Europe--where they were saved from the brutal bureaucracy of the Nazi Anschluss in the pockets of a family servant--and back to Japan and Europe again. Throughout, he writes with a tough, funny, and elegant attention to detail and personality that does full justice to the exactitude of the little carvings that first roused his curiosity. *--Tom Nissley*   From Publishers Weekly  In this family history, de Waal, a potter and curator of ceramics at the Victoria & Albert Museum, describes the experiences of his family, the Ephrussis, during the turmoil of the 20th century. Grain merchants in Odessa, various family members migrated to Vienna and Paris, becoming successful bankers. Secular Jews, they sought assimilation in a period of virulent anti-Semitism. In Paris, Charles Ephrussi purchased a large collection of Japanese netsuke, tiny hand-carved figures including a hare with amber eyes. The collection passed to Viktor Ephrussi in Vienna and became the family's greatest legacy. Loyal citizens of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Vienna Ephrussis were devastated by the outcome of WWI and were later driven from their home by the imposition of Nazi rule over Austria. After WWII, they discovered that their maid, Anna, had preserved the netsuke collection, which Ignace Ephrussi inherited, and he settled in postwar Japan. Today, the netsuke reside with de Waal (descended from the family's Vienna branch) and serve as the embodiment of his family history. A somewhat rambling narrative with special appeal to art historians, this account is nonetheless rich in drama and valuable anecdote. 20 b&w illus.

The nine essays collected here present different perspectives on Taiwanese visual culture and landscape during the Japanese colonial period (1895-1945), focusing variously on travel writings, Western and Japanese/Oriental-style paintings, architecture, aboriginal material culture, and crafts. Issues addressed include the imagined Taiwan and the \"discovery\" of the Taiwanese landscape, which developed into the imperial ideology of nangoku (southern country); the problematic idea of \"local color,\" which was imposed by Japanese, and its relation to the \"nativism\" that was embraced by Taiwanese; the gendered modernity exemplified in the representation of Chinese/Taiwanese women; and the development of Taiwanese artifacts and crafts from colonial to postcolonial times, from their discovery, estheticization, and industrialization to their commodification by both the colonizers and the colonized.The central theme of this volume is \"refracted modernity\"--the recursive and transferable nature of modernity--in the context of colonialism. Modernity and identity in Taiwanese visual culture emerged in the cross-cultural complexity engendered by Japanese colonization. Their formation involves a range of interdependent cultural transfers and appropriations between Europe, Japan, and Taiwan. Viewed in terms of refracted modernity, the state and product of localization/appropriation appears in an eclectic manner and is often characterized by the term \"hybrid.\" The notion of hybridity describes the complex state that results from the continuous dissemination and translation of cultures in colonial situations, thus revising the one-dimensional historical analytical models of colonialism. The model presented in this volume instead stresses original and creative aspects and renounces the notion of imitation, a judgment often imposed by the Eurocentric view.  Offering many examples of hybrid expressions that render Taiwanese visual culture unique and attractive, the case studies collectively make a strong argument for revising the traditional positioning of colonialism while offering a thought-provoking perspective on Taiwan's surge forward as a major force in contemporary art today.Refracted Modernity: Visual Culture and Identity in Colonial Taiwan will be of substantial interest to historians of Taiwan, China, and Japan; art historians of Chinese and Japanese art; and scholars of colonialism, decolonization, modernism, and modernity in general. Readers in the fields of anthropology, cultural studies, visual culture, and women's studies will find its essays timely and highly informative.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2007", "language": "english", "pages": "285 / 297", "ISBN10": "0824830504", "ISBN13": "9781435666252", "file": "PDF, 6.72 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/849845", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/849845/f07f04"},

One of the few critics who saw this at the time as a progressive development in his work was Dore Ashton, who here analyzes Guston's paintings and drawings in the context of the cultural milieu in which he worked, illuminating the dilemma facing artists who try to live with, understand, and express both the ideals of art and the reality of the world.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "1990", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "244", "ISBN10": "0520069323", "ISBN13": "9780585230535", "file": "PDF, 10.61 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1080873", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1080873/1ec55c"},

Zwemer", "Waldorf Early Childhood Asoociation"], "rating": "0", "description": "Post-Enlightenment notions of culture, which have been naturalized in the West for centuries, require that art be autonomously beautiful, universal, and devoid of any practical purpose. The authors of this multidisciplinary volume seek to complicate this understanding of art by examining art objects from across Asia with attention to their functional, ritual, and everyday contexts. From tea bowls used in the Japanese tea ceremony to television broadcasts of Javanese puppet theater; from Indian wedding chamber paintings to art looted by the British army from the Chinese emperor's palace; from the adventures of a Balinese magical dagger to the political functions of classical Khmer images-the authors challenge prevailing notions of artistic value by introducing new ways of thinking about culture.The chapters consider art objects as they are involved in the world: how they operate and are experienced in specific sites, collections, rituals, performances, political and religious events and imagination, and individual peoples' lives; how they move from one context to another and change meaning and value in the process (for example, when they are collected, traded, and looted, or when their images appear in art history textbooks); how their memories and pasts are or are not part of their meaning and experience. Rather than lead to a single universalizing definition of art, the essays offer multiple, divergent, and case-specific answers to the question What is the use of art? and argue for the need to study art as it is used and experienced. This series of case studies from Asia helps broaden and decolonize our understanding of what art is and assert the need to go beyond established ways of thinking about art in English-language scholarship.An engaging and wide-ranging collection, What's the Use of Art will appeal not only to  Asia art historians, historians, and anthropologists, but also to collectors and readers with an interest in museum studies and material culture studies.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2007", "publisher": "University of Hawaii Press", "language": "english", "pages": "325", "ISBN10": "0824830636", "ISBN13": "9780824830632", "file": "PDF, 11.78 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1000509", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1000509/433ee7"},

Authenticity and primitivism, both attacked by cultural critics, have died as concepts. At the same time, the penetration of nation-states, the tourist industry, and transnational corporations into regions that formerly produced these artifacts has severely reduced supplies of \"primitive art,\" bringing about a second \"death.\"Errington argues that the construction of the primitive in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (and the kinds of objects chosen to exemplify it) must be understood as a product of discourses of progress--from the nineteenth-century European narrative of technological progress, to the twentieth-century narrative of modernism, to the late- twentieth-century narrative of the triumph of the free market. In Part One she charts a provocative argument ranging through the worlds of museums, art theorists, mail-order catalogs, boutiques, tourism, and world events, tracing a loosely historical account of the transformations of meanings of primitive art in this century. In Part Two she explores an eclectic collection of public sites in Mexico and Indonesia--a national museum of anthropology, a cultural theme park, an airport, and a ninth-century Buddhist monument (newly refurbished)--to show how the idea of the primitive can be used in the interests of promoting nationalism and economic development.Errington's dissection of discourses about progress and primitivism in the contemporary world is both a lively introduction to anthropological studies of art institutions and a dramatic new contribution to the growing field of cultural studies.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "1998", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "pages": "333", "ISBN10": "0520212118", "ISBN13": "9780520210950", "file": "PDF, 9.25 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1207956", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1207956/e4600f"},

B. Reid (Author)", "Louise Chipley Slavicek"], "rating": "0", "description": "Since the 1960s, the artist Bruce Nauman has developed a highly complex                  and pluralistic oeuvre ranging from discrete sculpture, performance, film, video,                  and text-based works to elaborate multipart installations incorporating sound, video                  recording and monitors, and architectural structures. Nauman's work is often                  interpreted in terms of movements and mediums, including performance,                  postminimalism, process, and conceptual art, thereby emphasizing its apparent                  eclecticism. But what is often overlooked is that underlying these seemingly                  disparate artistic tendencies are conceptual continuities, one of which is an                  investigation of the nature of language.Unlike many of his contemporaries, Nauman                  has refrained from participating in the critical discourse surrounding his own work.                  He has given relatively few interviews over the course of his career and has little                  to do with the art press or critical establishment. Indeed, he granted Janet Kraynak                  and The MIT Press almost complete autonomy in the preparation of this volume. In                  contrast to Nauman?s reputation for silence, however, from the beginning of his                  career, the incorporation of language has been a central feature of his art. This                  collection takes as its starting point the seeming paradox of an artist of so few                  words who produces an art of so many words.Please Pay Attention Please contains all                  of Nauman's major interviews from 1965 to 2001, as well as a comprehensive body of                  his writings, including instructions and proposal texts, dialogues transcribed from                  audio-video works, and prose texts written specifically for installation sculptures.                  Where relevant, the texts are accompanied by illustrations of the artworks for which                  they were composed. In the critical essay that serves as the book's introduction,                  the editor investigates Nauman's art in relation to the linguistic turn in art                  practices of the 1960s?-understanding language through the speech act--and its                  legacy in contemporary art.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2005", "language": "english", "pages": "426 / 427", "ISBN10": "0262140829", "ISBN13": "9781423729570", "file": "PDF, 12.87 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/891047", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/891047/5e0965"},

Gupta", "Uma Gupta", "Nancy Thomson de Grummond", "Erika Simon"], "rating": "0", "description": "The ancient Mesoamerican city of Izapa in Chiapas, Mexico, is renowned for its extensive collection of elaborate stone stelae and altars, which were carved during the Late Preclassic period (300 BC-AD 250). Many of these monuments depict kings garbed in the costume and persona of a bird, a well-known avian deity who had great significance for the Maya and other cultures in adjacent regions. This Izapan style of carving and kingly representation appears at numerous sites across the Pacific slope and piedmont of Mexico and Guatemala, making it possible to trace political and economic corridors of communication during the Late Preclassic period. In this book, Julia Guernsey offers a masterful art historical analysis of the Izapan style monuments and their integral role in developing and communicating the institution of divine kingship. She looks specifically at how rulers expressed political authority by erecting monuments that recorded their performance of rituals in which they communicated with the supernatural realm in the persona of the avian deity.  She also considers how rulers used the monuments to structure their built environment and create spaces for ritual and politically charged performances. Setting her discussion in a broader context, Guernsey also considers how the Izapan style monuments helped to motivate and structure some of the dramatic, pan-regional developments of the Late Preclassic period, including the forging of a codified language of divine kingship. This pioneering investigation, which links monumental art to the matrices of political, economic, and supernatural exchange, offers an important new understanding of a region, time period, and group of monuments that played a key role in the history of Mesoamerica and continue to intrigue scholars within the field of Mesoamerican studies.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2006", "publisher": "University of Texas Press", "language": "english", "pages": "231", "ISBN10": "0292713231", "ISBN13": "9780292713239", "file": "PDF, 31.56 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/768072", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/768072/0a47b4"},

First published in 1890, The Golden Bough was eventually issued in a twelve-volume edition (1906-15) which was abridged in 1922 by the author and his wife. That abridgement has never been reconsidered for a modern audience. In it some of the more controversial passages were dropped, including Frazer's daring speculations on the Crucifixion of Christ. For the first time this one-volume edition restores Frazer's bolder theories and sets them within the framework of a valuable introduction and notes. A seminal work of modern anthropology, The Golden Bough also influenced many twentieth-century writers, including D H Lawrence, T S Eliot, and Wyndham Lewis. Its discussion of magical types, the sacrificial killing of kings, the dying god, and the scapegoat is given fresh pertinence in this new edition.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2009", "edition": "Reissue", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "858", "ISBN10": "0199538824", "file": "PDF, 79.19 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/16411486", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16411486/d455ee"},

The artists whose work and practices are discussed include Fra Angelico, Donatello, Leonardo da Vinci, Filippino Lippi, Giovanni Bellini, Raphael, Parmigianino, Titian, Bronzino, Johannes Gumpp and Rembrandt van Rijn.

This book argues that the extraordinary force of the image in contemporary life\u2014the contemporary imaginary\u2014can be traced back to the Byzantine iconoclastic controversy of the eighth and ninth centuries.   It was during this period that the church was compelled to produce an account of the theological status of the religious image that would nevertheless not be open to even the slightest suspicion of idolatry.  The solution arrived at was the dual doctrine of the image, invisible (and thus beyond the charge of idolatry) and the icon, visible, and thus perfectly fitted to be placed at the center of a pedagogical and political strategy serving the temporal power of the church.  The foundations of this immense philosophical enterprise were laid in no less than the multifarious, interwoven strands of the divine economy, God's overall plan for the salvation of humanity.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2004", "edition": "1", "language": "english", "pages": "280 / 142", "ISBN10": "0804741018", "ISBN13": "9780804741019", "file": "PDF, 10.34 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1010347", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1010347/e891b5"},

Christopher M. S. Johns's refreshingly original study explores a neglected facet of Canova's career: the effects of patrons, patronage, and politics on his choice of subjects and manner of working. While other artists produced art in the service of the state, Canova resisted the blandishments of the political powers that commissioned his works.Johns uses letters, diaries, and biographies to establish a political personality for Canova as an individual and an artist of international reputation. Though he had patrons as diverse as the pope, Napoleon, the Austrian Hapsburgs, the Prince Regent of Great Britain, and the Republic of Venice, Canova remained steadily employed and did so without controversy. A conservative and a Catholic, he devised a strategy that enabled him to work for patrons who were avowed enemies while remaining true to the cultural and artistic heritage of his Italian homeland. Using myth and funerary images and avoiding portraiture, he disguised the meanings behind his works and thus avoided their being identified with any political purpose.Johns greatly enhances our understanding of Canova's place in European art and political history, and in showing the influence of censorship, display, visual narrative, and propaganda, he highlights issues as contentious today as they were in Canova's time.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "1998", "edition": "1", "publisher": "University of California Press", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0520212010", "ISBN13": "9780520212015", "file": "EPUB, 3.05 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1174547/0462fd"},

This book, more than any other we know, traces the steps that went into that revolution and simultaneously makes the argument that the letter forms themselves are in process of evolution. Tracy argues that, whether they are of the sixteenth or the twentieth century, the forms that comprise our alphabet are subject to the same rules of good taste, proportion, and clarity that have always obtained. But what we face today is vastly different from fifty years ago. For the first time, new technology has made the proliferation (and, as some would maintain, debasement) of letter forms fast and easy (or quick and dirty.)   With fifty years of professional experience on both sides of the Atlantic (including thirty years as head of type design for the British Linotype Company), Tracy is in a unique position to make this argument and arrive at his sad conclusion: the design of distinguished, contemporary typefaces is far outnumbered by the mediocre and downright bad. Part of the reason for this deplorable deterioration is a lack of critical analysis of the particular esthetics involved.

Nearly six hundred years ago, a short, genial, cannily alert man in his late thirties took a very old manuscript off a library shelf, saw with excitement what he had discovered, and ordered that it be copied. That book was the last surviving manuscript of an ancient Roman philosophical epic, On the Nature of Things, by Lucretius\u2014a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functioned without the aid of gods, that religious fear was damaging to human life, and that matter was made up of very small particles in eternal motion, colliding and swerving in new directions.   The copying and translation of this ancient book-the greatest discovery of the greatest book-hunter of his age-fueled the Renaissance, inspiring artists such as Botticelli and thinkers such as Giordano Bruno; shaped the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson. 16 pages full-color illustrations", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2011", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "W.

And yet, as Hannah Higgins makes clear in this engaging and evocative book, the grid has a history that long predates modernity; it is the most prominent visual structure in Western culture. In The Grid Book, Higgins examines the history of ten grids that changed the world: the brick, the tablet, the gridiron city plan, the map, musical notation, the ledger, the screen, moveable type, the manufactured box, and the net. Charting the evolution of each grid, from the Paleolithic brick of ancient Mesopotamia through the virtual connections of the Internet, Higgins demonstrates that once a grid is invented, it may bend, crumble, or shatter, but its organizing principle never disappears. The appearance of each grid was a watershed event. Brick, tablet, and city gridiron made possible sturdy housing, the standardization of language, and urban development. Maps, musical notation, financial ledgers, and moveable type promoted the organization of space, music, and time, international trade, and mass literacy. The screen of perspective painting heralded the science of the modern period, classical mechanics, and the screen arts, while the standardization of space made possible by the manufactured box suggested the purified box forms of industrial architecture and visual art. The net, the most ancient grid, made its first appearance in Stone Age Finland; today, the loose but clearly articulated networks of the World Wide Web suggest that we are in the middle of an emergent grid that is reshaping the world, as grids do, in its image.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2009", "publisher": "The MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "312 / 310", "ISBN10": "0262512408", "ISBN13": "9780262512404", "file": "PDF, 6.85 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2207598", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2207598/99ea45"},

Yet by the end of World War II, almost the only thing remaining of their vast empire was a collection of 264 wood and ivory carvings, none of them larger than a matchbox.The renowned ceramicist Edmund de Waal became the fifth generation to inherit this small and exquisite collection of netsuke. Entranced by their beauty and mystery, he determined to trace the story of his family through the story of the collection.The netsuke\u2014drunken monks, almost-ripe plums, snarling tigers\u2014were gathered by Charles Ephrussi at the height of the Parisian rage for all things Japanese. Charles had shunned the place set aside for him in the family business to make a study of art, and of beautiful living. An early supporter of the Impressionists, he appears, oddly formal in a top hat, in Renoir\u2019s Luncheon of the Boating Party. Marcel Proust studied Charles closely enough to use him as a model for the aesthete and lover Swann in Remembrance of Things Past.Charles gave the carvings as a wedding gift to his cousin Viktor in Vienna; his children were allowed to play with one netsuke each while they watched their mother, the Baroness Emmy, dress for ball after ball. Her older daughter grew up to disdain fashionable society. Longing to write, she struck up a correspondence with Rilke, who encouraged her in her poetry.The Anschluss changed their world beyond recognition. Ephrussi and his cosmopolitan family were imprisoned or scattered, and Hitler\u2019s theorist on the \u201cJewish question\u201d appropriated their magnificent palace on the Ringstrasse. A library of priceless books and a collection of Old Master paintings were confiscated by the Nazis. But the netsuke were smuggled away by a loyal maid, Anna, and hidden in her straw mattress. Years after the war, she would find a way to return them to the family she\u2019d served even in their exile.In The Hare with Amber Eyes, Edmund de Waal unfolds the story of a remarkable family and a tumultuous century. Sweeping yet intimate, it is a highly original meditation on art, history, and family, as elegant and precise as the netsuke themselves.", "categories": "Arts - History & Criticism", "year": "2010", "edition": "First U.S.", "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "language": "english", "pages": "368", "ISBN10": "0374105979", "ISBN13": "9780374105976", "file": "EPUB, 1.12 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1305778/9ad6b1"},

Meadow and Bruce RobertsonSamuel Quiccheberg\u2019s\u00a0Inscriptiones, first published in Latin in 1565, is an ambitious effort to demonstrate the pragmatic value of curiosity cabinets, or\u00a0Wunderkammern, to princely collectors in sixteenth-century Europe and, by so doing, inspire them to develop their own such collections. Quiccheberg shows how the assembly and display of physical objects offered nobles a powerful means to expand visual knowledge, allowing them to incorporate empirical and artisanal expertise into the realm of the written word. But in mapping out the collectability of the material world, Quiccheberg did far more than create a taxonomy. Rather, he demonstrated how organizing objects made their knowledge more accessible; how objects, when juxtaposed or grouped, could tell a story; and how such strategies could enhance the value of any single object.Quiccheberg\u2019s descriptions of early modern collections provide both a point of origin for today\u2019s museums and an implicit critique of their aims, asserting the fundamental research and scholarly value of collections: collections are to be used, not merely viewed.\u00a0The First Treatise on Museums\u00a0makes Quiccheberg\u2019s now rare publication available in an English translation. Complementing the translation are a critical introduction by Mark A. Meadow and a preface by Bruce Robertson.Mark A. Meadow is associate professor in the Department of History of Art and Architecture at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His publications include\u00a0Pieter Bruegel the Elder\u2019s Netherlandish Proverbs and the Practice of Rhetoric\u00a0(Waanders: Zwolle, 2002) and a translation of Symon Andriessoon\u2019s\u00a0Duytsche Adagia ofte Spreecwoorden\u00a0(Verloren: Hilversum, 2003).

In this catalogue, which was written to accompany an international traveling exhibition organized by the Walters Art Gallery, Ellen Reeder turns to classical Greek marbles, bronzes, terracottas, and vases to help illustrate the ways in which women were perceived and how they lived. The discussion is enhanced through interpretive essays written for this catalogue by a group of eminent classicists and historians.  Reeder finds a particular emphasis on myths dealing with the unmarried maiden and the difficulty of the transition to marriage and motherhood--as exemplified in the stories of Danae, Thetis, Atalanta, and Amymone. She also explores images of containers and untamed animals as metaphors for women; rituals involving women, such as the wedding and the cult of the Little Bears at Brauron; the character and cult of goddesses; and the close association of women with textiles.  The catalogue contains interpretive essays by Sally Humphreys, Mary Lefkowitz, Franois Lissarrague, John Oakley, Margot Schmidt, H. A. Shapiro, Christiane Sourvinou- Inwood, Andrew Stewart, and Froma Zeitlin.

And yet, in fact, museums are visited by only a small segment of the population. What are the characteristics of those who display their love of art by strolling through the aisles of museums, and what distinguishes them from the majority of people who are effectively excluded, or exclude themselves, from their doors? In this study, Bourdieu and Darbel address such questions on the basis of a wide-ranging survey of museum visitors throughout Europe. By examining the social conditions of museum practices, they show that cultivated taste is not a natural gift but a socially inculcated disposition which is distributed unevenly, and which predisposes some to distinguish themselves through their love of art, while others are deprived of this privilege.", "categories": "Arts - Museums & Collections", "year": "1991", "publisher": "Stanford University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "189", "ISBN10": "0804715580", "ISBN13": "9780804715584", "file": "PDF, 8.51 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/690058", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/690058/aad63d"},

This innovative approach balances the need for an intellectual understanding of structural elements with multiple opportunities to experience the language within its cultural context. From the outset, learners are presented with samples of authentic language that are context-sensitive and culturally coherent. Instructional time is used primarily to rehearse interactions that learners of Japanese are likely to encounter in the future, whether they involve speaking, listening, writing, or reading. Level 1 comprises two textbooks and accompanying activity books. These four books incombination with audio files allow instructors to adapt a beginning-level course, such as the first year of collect Japanese, to their students' needs. They focus on language and modeled behavior, providing opportunities for learners to acquire language through performance templates. Online resources provide additional support for both students and instructors. Audio files, videos, supplementary exercises, and a teachers' manual are available at www.routledge.com/9781138304147.

Franklin", "Andrea Olsen", "Caryn McHose"], "rating": "0", "description": "In this book the notions of real learning and equality are approached as processes of becoming leading to the figuration of new worlds through local curations of learning and practice. Though its main theses are mainly grounded in the context of art practice and education they have a much wider application to other (perhaps all) contexts of learning through the notions of pedagogies against the state and pedagogies of the event. Learning is conceived as a political act rather than, for example, an incremental process of psychological or sociological development.     Most chapters of the book deal with a series of tensions between tradition and the new; between art in education and contemporary art; between ontologies of practice and epistemologies of assessment; between socio-cultural notions of difference and an egalitarian notion of the Same, between an ethics of reality, of established values, principles and practices and an ethics of the real; between the different ontological domains of the artist and the teacher which are brought together in the constituency of the artist-teacher, between knowledge and not-knowing, between know\u00acledge and truth.    The intention is not to resolve such tensions as such attempted resolution will always be incomplete, rather they are discussed in the spirit of an imperative to decide what kind of future we want for pedagogical spaces of teaching and learning.     The text draws upon key ideas from the philosophical work of Alain Badiou, Judith Butler, Jacques Ranciere, Slavoj Zizek , Jacques Lacan and others and these are applied to pedagogical spaces in order to initiate a debate about teaching and learning. The book raises some important questions relating to subjectification, ethics, multiculturalism and the struggles inherent to the tensionalities of becoming an artist-teacher.    \"Dennis Atkinson has written an important and compelling book to revision the teaching of art for the 21st century in our schools. This an absolute must read for art educators who continue to strive to make a transformative difference in public education.  It is a remarkable achievement in foresight and leadership. Atkinson raises the most difficult questions concerning subjectification, ethics, multiculturalism, assessment and the tensions and benefits of becoming an artist educator.  He draws on the leading edge of contemporary cultural and artistic theory focusing on the writings of Butler, Lacan Badiou, Ranci\u00e8re as well as Bourriaud,Deleuze and Guattari.\" jan jagodzinski", "categories": "Arts - Study & Teaching", "year": "2011", "publisher": "Sense Publishers", "language": "english", "pages": "193", "ISBN10": "9460914535", "ISBN13": "9789460914539", "file": "PDF, 1.72 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1240916", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1240916/de5750"},

At base of these margins, sits an attitude, which values mixed levels of fantasy, reality and logic and accepts unexpected results. Therefore, this new edition will feature how the AIL artists from the disciplines of sculpture, installation, performance and sound and AIL partner scientists from the disciplines of physics, computer technologies, environmental ecology and cognitive analysis have complimented each others research from 2006 to 2009. While scientists have certainly learnt about art, artists have become more involved in ethical and social debates about scientific discovery in relation to society. In this book the potentials of networking in these margins are reflected upon by 9 prominent authors, 12 artists and 12 leading scientific researchers from various Laboratories.", "categories": "Arts - Study & Teaching", "year": "2010", "edition": "1st Edition.", "publisher": "Springer Vienna Architecture", "language": "english", "pages": "206", "ISBN10": "3709103207", "ISBN13": "9783709103203", "file": "PDF, 10.21 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1072483", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1072483/7b9f46"},

Drawing: The Enactive Evolution of the Practitioner redefines drawing more holistically as an enactive phenomenon, one reliant on motor responses, and makes connections between a variety of disciplines in order to find out what happens when we draw. Instead of the finite event of producing an artifact, drawing is a process and an end in itself. By synthesizing enactive thinking and the practice of drawing, this volume provides valuable insights into the creative mind, and will appeal to scholars and practitioners alike.", "categories": "Arts - Study & Teaching", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Intellect Books", "language": "english", "pages": "298", "ISBN10": "1841503258", "ISBN13": "9781841503950", "file": "PDF, 6.73 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1251054", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1251054/3c8aeb"},

These 101 maxims, meditations, and demonstrations offer both a toolkit of ideas for                 the art student and a set of guiding principles for the artist. Complementing each                 of the 101 succinct texts is an equally expressive drawing by the artist, often                 based on a historical or contemporary work of art, offering a visual correlative to                 the written thought. \"Art can be anything\" is illustrated by a drawing of                 Duchamp's famous urinal; a description of chiaroscuro art is illuminated by an image                 \"after Caravaggio\"; a lesson on time and media is accompanied by a view of                 a Jenny Holzer projection; advice about surviving a critique gains resonance from                 Piero della Francesca's arrow-pierced Saint Sebastian. 101 Things to Learn in Art                 School offers advice about the issues artists confront across all artistic media,                 but this is no simple handbook to making art. It is a guide to understanding art as                 a description of the world we live in, and it is a guide to using art as a medium                 for thought. And so this book belongs on the reading list of art students, art                 teachers, and artists, but it also belongs in the library of everyone who cares                 about art as a way of understanding life.", "categories": "Arts - Study & Teaching", "year": "2011", "publisher": "The MIT Press", "language": "english", "pages": "224", "ISBN10": "0262016214", "ISBN13": "9780262016216", "file": "PDF, 6.80 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1196423", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1196423/29bb5d"},

This hands-on book is organized into 52 units, which may, but don't need to be explored on a weekly basis. The labs can be worked on in any order, so that you can flip around to learn a new mixed-media technique or be inspired by a particular painting theme or application. The underlying message of this book is that, as an artist, you should learn and gain expertise through experimentation and play. There is no right or wrong result, rather you will find new forms of expression in your work and gain confidence in your skills.\u00a0Designed to inform and inspire new artists and rekindle passion for painting in experienced artists, this book offers a range of exercises broken down by theme: Who (artist-inspired), What (tools and materials), When (a time-based concept), Where (a sense of place), and How (inspired by a technique or method). \u00a0\u00a0Paint Lab is illustrated with brilliant full-color images and multiple examples of each exercise. This book offers you a visual, non-linear approach to learning painting techniques, and reinforces a fun and fearless approach to creating art.", "categories": "Arts - Painting", "year": "2013", "publisher": "Quarry Books", "language": "english", "pages": "136", "ISBN10": "1592537820", "ISBN13": "9781592537822", "file": "PDF, 29.51 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2215814", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2215814/3be589"},

Popular artist and teacher, Soraya French, encourages readers to experiment with mixing media and to create more adventurous paintings and broaden their artistic horizons.  The media that Soraya uses in this book are acrylics, pastels and collage and she shows how to bring the best out of mixing these media with handy tips, some simple projects and several step-by-step demonstrations.  Landscape, and the way it changes over the seasons, is the ideal subject for experimenting with different textural effects using mixed media. Contemporary Landscapes in Mixed Media is divided into four seasonal chapters, with each section dealing with the colours, shapes, patterns and textures particular to each season.
