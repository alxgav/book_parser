But when the weather turns dry and grasses die, the locusts are forced to live close together, and they go through amazing changes. Their colors become brighter, and their eyes become larger. They fly off in great swarms searching for food. Millions of locusts might land in a farmer's field and have a feast. When nothing green is left, the swarm flies off again. After they finally run out of food, the locusts separate and change again. In this exciting book, you can learn what makes locusts similar to and different from other insects. Close-up photographs and diagrams reveal extraordinary details about locusts' bodies, both inside and out. This book contains hands-on activities that help you understand how far locusts jump and how they make sounds.

Keen", "David Fott"], "rating": "0", "description": "Editor\u2019s Choice, Science Books & Films  Date: May/June 2001    The Peregrine\u2019s Journey: A Story of Migration is based on the migration of a real female peregrine falcon that was tracked via satellite telemetry by the U.S. Wildlife Service from its summer residence in Alaska to its wintering grounds in Argentina, over 8,000 miles away.  The author begins the book by describing the events in September that signal the peregrine that it is time to migrate.  When the bird begins her migration, she tells how she uses instinct and her excellent eyesight to identify mountains and rivers that guide her on her way south.     The migration requires a lot of energy and exposes the peregrine to numerous dangers.  The author tells how the peregrine eats pigeons, doves and other prey and how she bathes herself after eating a messy meal.  Since migration is tiring, the peregrine stops on the Texas coast to rest and to build up a reserve of energy for her long flight over the Gulf of Mexico.  During her first night over the water, she perches on a ship\u2019s mast to rest.  A few days later, she flies over Guatemala and then Panama.  Along the way, she joins other peregrines on their way south and a flock of Swainson\u2019s and broad-winged hawks flying the same route.  From Panama, she flies over the ocean to Colombia and then on to Brazil.  As she nears the end of her journey, she begins to fly fewer miles each day.  One night in Bolivia, she is lucky and does not wind up being dinner for a great horned owl.  Finally, the falcon arrives in Argentina; where she will stay until next March, when she migrates back to Alaska.     This well-illustrated, well-written book provides a wealth of information about peregrine falcons, bird migration, and predator-prey relationships.  It would be an excellent addition to a school library or to a child\u2019s personal library.  I recommend The Peregrine\u2019s Journal highly.    \u2014James W.

He entices it to eat \"jum-jills,\" a concoction he makes up from seven nut cakes, five seed puddings, two cabbage salads, and fifteen little cheeses, all rolled into little balls. A happy ending is assured when the Funny Thing discovers he loves jum-jills and is convinced that they will make his tail grow longer and his blue points grow more beautiful. He returns each day for the treats and never eats another doll.    Best known for her Newbery Honor winner, Millions of Cats, Wanda G?g (1893-1946) was a pioneer in children's book writing and illustration. Her ground-breaking technique of integrating illustrations with the text is evident in all of her classic books. Born in New Ulm, Minnesota, she rose from poverty to international acclaim as a children's book author, artist, and illustrator. In recognition of her artistry, she was posthumously awarded the 1958 Lewis Carroll Shelf Award for Millions of Cats and the 1977 Kerlan Award for her body of work.", "categories": "Children's Books - Animals", "year": "2003", "language": "english", "pages": "32 / 33", "ISBN10": "0816642419", "ISBN13": "9780816695362", "file": "PDF, 2.96 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/856650", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/856650/f6bd80"},

Toklo, Kallik, Lusa, and Ujurak have finally reached the Last Great Wilderness, the legendary bear paradise they've been searching for. But while his companions think they've come to the end of their long journey, Ujurak feels a deep unrest. Is this truly where they're meant to be?   In the Last Great Wilderness, one by one the bears begin to remember their true natures. Toklo feels the urge to hunt caribou and mark his territory as a brown bear should, and Kallik feels the pull of the ice within her. It's only Lusa, happy just to be in the wild, who fears the day when her friends will leave her to follow their own paths.   As the bears adjust to this new life, disaster strikes. The friends are forced to venture into the world of the flat-faces to save the life of one of their own. Once there, the end of their journey seems farther away than ever, as a new path spreads out before them.", "categories": "Children's Books - Animals", "year": "2010", "publisher": "HarperCollins", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0060871318", "ISBN13": "9780061969744", "file": "EPUB, 786 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1171339/fea18f"},

Their secret weapon is being able to hide in plain sight. To protect themselves from predators, they have developed long, narrow bodies. They blend right in to the branches they live on. Some stick insects even have extra growths that look like leaves for more camouflage. Stick insects also protect themselves by being most active at night when it is even harder to see them. They escape from predators by dropping to the forest floor, where they look like fallen sticks and leaves. In this exciting book, you can learn what makes stick insects similar to and different from other insects. Close-up photographs and diagrams reveal extraordinary details about stick insects' bodies, both inside and out. And you can perform activities that help you observe how stick insects live and how they hide by keeping still.

Like the time he had a difficult encounter with a policeman or when he found himself in deep water with a newspaper reporter. But since arriving from his native Peru after an earthquake Paddington has always felt at home with the Brown family who found him on Paddington station. Then one day, a surprise visitor arrives at thirty-two Windsor Gardens. Is it time for Paddington to decide where 'home' really is?  In 2008 Michael Bond's first novel featuring the adventures of Paddington Bear will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. Paddington's amazing ability to get into and out of trouble is at the heart of the countless stories that have been loved the world over ever since.  However, it is many years since a new novel has been published, and in celebration of this landmark, Michael Bond has written the funniest and the most moving Paddington novel ever.", "categories": "Children's Books - Animals", "year": "2009", "edition": "Reprint", "language": "english", "pages": "176 / 180", "ISBN10": "0007269404", "ISBN13": "9780007269402", "file": "PDF, 1.34 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/841728", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/841728/27e9be"},

Bubba learns to wear a saddle and bridle, and then his challenges begin when he loses his home in the Arabian Show Farm, becomes a carriage horse and even more adventures ensue.", "categories": "Children's Books - Animals", "year": "2015", "edition": "1", "publisher": "CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform", "language": "english", "pages": "136", "ISBN13": "9781511588010", "file": "EPUB, 421 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/4872564/efde0e"},

Nesbit", "Peyo", "Philip M. Parker"], "rating": "0", "description": "At the heart of any great work of literature is a story. William Shakespeare's plays are no exception. His plays tell stories of kings and queens, of ghosts and witches, of romance and passion. But to get to the story at the heart of the plays, the reader must first work through Shakespeare's language, a task often too great for younger readers (and for many adults). Now, in this new edition, E. Nesbit, the classic British children's author, brings ten of Shakespeare's greatest plays to life. She shakes off the burdensome complexity of Shakespeare's language and tells the stories at the core of the plays. Sprinkled with her own dashes of wit and humor, her graceful, vivid retellings, using accessible language, are the perfect introduction to Shakespeare's work. Nesbit's stories are also the perfect way for adults to brush up on the ins and outs of Shakespeare's plays. Who can remember the names of King Lear's three daughters? Was Romeo a Montagu or a Capulet? What, exactly, was Hamlet's problem? All of these major works are included in this collection: Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, The Merchant of Venice, The Tempest, As You Like It, The Winter's Tale, and Twelfth Night. The text is illustrated throughout with dramatic black and white photographs from modern productions of the plays by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Stratford Festival (Ontario, Canada), and the Folger Library's Shakespeare Theater, bringing the action and characters to life. Also included is an afterword by Peter Hunt, a leading scholar of children's literature. These retellings of the classic tales of one of the world's greatest playwrights remind us that it is never too early for Shakespeare.", "categories": "Children's Books - Arts, Music & Photography", "year": "1997", "edition": "1ST", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "language": "english", "pages": "112 / 113", "ISBN10": "0195116895", "ISBN13": "9780195116892", "file": "PDF, 739 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1091801", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1091801/c68e2f"},

Take your pick of operation,realistic locomotives and rolling stock (cars),track, scenery, electronic wizardry, or whatever;work alone, with a friend or two, or in a large club.All of these diverse combinations are available foryour pleasure in this hobby of kings and adventurousmen from the Arctic to the Congo.Model railroading has changed about as much asany hobby can. New labor saving products allowmany times the former realism and precision. Itnow takes less of your labor than anyone everimagined possible. Ready-to-run locomotives haveas much or more detail than many custom-builtmodels of years past, and they cost much less.You can still build your own cars, locomotives,or track from kits, or just the raw materials (thisis called \"scratch building\"); If it's instant actionyou seek, you can simply combine ready-to-runcomponents into an enjoyable model railroad andactually build very little, or you can build uniqueand super-detailed segments of the hobby that suityour interests. This suit-yourself aspect is the realkey to why this hobby is so masculine, exciting,creative - and especially FUN!A 'seasoned' model railroader may prefer a layoutduplicating the equipment used only during the\"glory years\" when the steam locomotive was powerfulevidence of the monopoly that the real railroadshad over the transport of people or products.The true buff may decide to specialize in thehuge freight cars and ponderous, but colorful, diesellocomotives of the ' ultra-modem present. Someeven combine both by relegating the 'old' steampoweredtrains to operation on smaller sub-railroadscalled branch lines. This leaves the \"main line\"freight and passenger hauling to the modem diesel.Either \u00b7 way, there is the ever-present thrill of seeingyour own trains snaking thru a long sweepingcurve, across spindly bridges, thru tunnels andvast \"acres\" of cars in the railroad yards. The ideais, that all of this was created with a sweep of thehand by you, the \"empire builder.\"Don't let all this talk of a railroad empire seemto be beyond you. Another attribute of this hobbyis that you need only complete as much of the railroadas you wish, at the rate of progress to matchthe leisure time you can devote to it. Better yet, isthe fact that a model railroad need never be 'finished'in the true sense of the word. There is alwaysthe challenge of new locomotives or rolling stock.You can add improvements, branch lines, yards, orjust detail or revise what has all ready been completed.Add to this the thrill of actual operation.By operation I mean running trains so they functionlike real ones. Plan on hauling freight or peo-;pIe from one point to another with a set timetableand/ or a sharp look-out for other trains operatingat the same time. Operation can include the \"hotshot\" freight booming across the landscape, orthat night mail train, or a 'peddler' freight jostlingits cars from sidings along the main tracks, or atiny switcher making up trains in the yards.Many model RR buffs still insist on only theolder 'period' model railroads, while others preferultra-modem 'periods' of time. Many enjoy specializingin equipment that is a copy of one particularfull sized railroad. This type of specialization oftenforces one into using the handcrafted importedbrass locomotives. It may also require buildingmany of the cars from 'craftsman-type' kits whichare more costly than the mass-produced plasticand metal products which satisfy most of us.We hope that this book will give a better ideaof the vast selection of products available, and howto use them for the most effective and enjoyablemodel railroad.When entering the hobby, one of the firstchoices must be which scale to pick for your futurerailroad empire. Four scales are now popular inAmerica: N scale, which is about 1/ 160 of life-size,HO scale at about 1/ 87 of life-size, S scale at about1/ 60, and 0 scale at about 1/ 48. Some buffs feelthat the larger a model is the more realistic it appears,so they choose the larger scales of 0 or S.Others think that it is more realistic to have longtrains, so they select the smaller scales of HO or N.It is important to remember that the size of a modelis a relative thing. An HO scale boxcar will seemsmall if compared to one in 0 scale, but the sameHO car will appear huge if set beside one in Nscale. Compare all of the various scales before youchoose. Consider that other factors favor one scaleover another. Include such things as the amountof visible detail, the selection of equipment available,and the amount of space you can afford.At present, HO scale offers about ten-times thenumber of different locomotives, cars, track, buildings,or whatever. If your tastes in equipment areextremely hard to satisfy, then HO is your bestchoice. About 80 % of the model railroaders agreeon that. The other three scales have enough varietyto satisfy most of us.N scale is the smallest size and the newest ofthe four popular scales, having been available withAmerican style engines and cars just recently. It'sthe fastest growing scale right now with dozens ofnew items every month, and, if it's accepted as wellas anticipated, there should be almost as wide achoice as in HO within a few years. Because of itstiny size, there are fewer kits in N scale. Mostequipment is of the ready-to-run variety.The selection of a space for your model railroadis no longer the problem it used to be. A 2 x 4-foot area is ample for a really nice N scale layout(the Bedbox Central in later pages is only 20\" x47\"). A small yard or industry complex can be fittedinto this space in HO scale as well, so that evenapartment dwellers can find a place for their\"empire\" by storing it under a bed, or in a closet.Even the space across the top of a bookcase isenough for an N or an HO scale yard. Many pleasurablehours can be spent making up trains for an-imagined trip over the main line, then uncouplingthem to assort the various cars to specific sidingsor yard tracks. All this is possible with either manualor remote-control operation of the couplers andswitches, using a miniature switch engine. This typeof a model layout offers a testing ground for ideasand plans that may be incorporated into that biggerempire you will want to build someday.Many of us, including some apartment dwellers,can negotiate for a model railroad \"right-of-way\"in an area of about 4 x 8 feet by building a cabinetso that the layout will fold up against the wall. when not in use. Some suspend it above the car inthe garage by using ropes and pulleys so that itcould be lowered onto temporary legs for operation.The 4 x 8-foot size is about the minimum fora model railroad layout in S or 0 scales, is 'passable'for HO, and excellent for N scale. If you cannegotiate for an even larger area, so much the better.The best spot is a spare room in the house,followed by an attic or basement, then half, or all,of a garage. Your local hobby shop or library canprovide books that give detailed track plans forany scale, in any size area.You can build or operate your railroad at anytime you wish, and, you'll find that 'fellow modelrails' are a really friendly lot. They are happy toshare their experience and enjoyment with others.The quickest way to locate other model railroadersin your area is to keep in contact with a local hobbydealer. He can usually direct you to clubs or privatemodel railroads whose owners will welcome a politeand courteous visitor. An appointment should bemade in advance by telephone.Now that you've decided on a scale and negotiatedfor an area for your empire, you can give seriousthought to getting started. The simplest andmost economical introduction to the hobby is topurchase one of the ready-to-run train sets. You'llsave $5 to $20 over the cost of the individual itemsout of the set, and you can expand any of the setsinto whatever type of a model railroad appealsmost to you. Be sure to get a good power packto convert house current to the common 12 voltsDC current, with a rheostat built in to controltrain speed. Some sets include them, but, if not,about $12 will buy a small one.Normally, the train sets include an oval, orother simple plug-together track sections, plusthe locomotive and some cars. The size and complexityof the locomotive and the number of carsand accessory items will determine the price of theset. In 0 or S scale, the complete sets are pricedbetween $25 and $225. The HO scale sets rangefrom about $21 to $65, including power pack, withthe 'average' set at about $40. N scale sets rangefrom $18 to $50 with power pack, with averageprices at about $37 . .If the kit building aspects of the hobby appealto you, you could make your first investment asingle car kit. These and all other items are discussedlater in this book.Here is as good a place as any to consider thetools and work space you'll want. The cost is lowfor an expandable selection of tools. You'll want toprovide a drawer or shelf-box for storage. At first, ascrap of wood and the desk or kitchen table willmake an adequate work area. It's a good idea tostart with at least one simple kit to familiarizeyourself with the various pieces. Your hobby dealercan be a great help in picking out a kit to suityour skills. From here you can expand into themodel railroad hobby as rapidly as desired. Wehope these pages can give you at least a slightindication of the fun and relaxation this hobbywill provide.", "categories": "Children's Books - Cars, Trains & Things That Go", "year": "1967", "edition": "Winter", "publisher": "Delta Magazines Inc.", "language": "english", "pages": "116", "file": "PDF, 27.13 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/16642754", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16642754/3943f8"},

Her father is a known criminal who once used Ashley to help him elude justice, and in his attempt to escape, a life was taken. He now sits in federal prison, but still casts a shadow over Ashley's life. In the meantime, Ashley has bounced from foster home to foster home and represents a real challenge to the social workers who try to help her--not because she's inherently bad, but because trouble always seems to find her.Ashley's latest set of presumably short-term foster parents are Kitch and Yuka Nolan. Like Ashley, Kitch happens to be an artist. Yuka, on the other hand, is a geneticist working for a very high-level tech company, one that's contracted out to work for the government and the military. And it's Yuka's latest top secret project that has her very concerned. Developed for the military, it's a set of body paints that, when applied to the wearer, grant them a wide range of special powers. Fearful that this invention will be misused, Yuka sneaks the set of paints home, substituting a dummy suitcase with an ordinary set of paints in their place.From here, signals get crossed. Ashley comes home from school one day with her new friend Luke and, thinking that the Nolans have purchased a surprise gift for her upcoming birthday, finds the set of paints. Being an artist, Ashley naturally assumes these are for her. It isn't long before she realizes that she's stumbled upon something much bigger and a lot more dangerous. Although she uses her newly discovered powers for good, it's not long before the military becomes wise to what happened to their secret weapon.

The strong, larger-than-life heroes of the Olympians can summon lightning, control the sea, turn invisible, or transform themselves into any animal they choose. Superheroes? No! Greek gods. The ancient pantheon comes to explosive life in this new series where myth meets comic books. Epic battles, daring quests, and terrible monsters await readers within the pages of these books. Volume 2, Athena: Grey-Eyed Goddess, is the tale of the goddess of wisdom and war, recounting her many adventures. Review in 3/15 Kirkus Following the series opener that chronicled Zeus\u2019s origin story, O\u2019Connor\u2019s next relates the details of his daughter Athena\u2019s birth and some of the stories about her. The three Fates narrate in stately language, briefly recapping the rise of the Olympians before turning to Zeus\u2019s relationship with Metis, which ends when he eats her to avoid his prophesied overthrow by their child. Following Athena\u2019s miraculous emergence from his head, fully grown, she struggles to find her place in the world and among the gods. The Fates go on to recount how she adopted the first name Pallas and acquired the components of her Aegis, which includes the story of Perseus and Andromeda, and Athena\u2019s confrontation with Arachne. While less unified in narrative structure than the previous book, this nevertheless shares its strengths\u2014a balance between heightened narration and colloquial dialogue, superb graphic storytelling with extended wordless action sequences, energetic backmatter and a palpable fondness for the subject matter.

C'est au d\u00e9but du XXe si\u00e8cle que Maria Montessori, l'une des premi\u00e8res femmes m\u00e9decins d'Italie, fonda sa premi\u00e8re \"Maison des Enfants\", v\u00e9ritable laboratoire de recherche p\u00e9dagogique. Elle y mit au point une m\u00e9thode d'enseignement d'une efficacit\u00e9 exceptionnelle, adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 tous les enfants et respectueuse de leur rythme d'apprentissage. Les petits Montessori. La collection \"Les petits Montessori\" propose aux parents d'accompagner leur enfant dans le d\u00e9veloppement de son autonomie et de son intelligence. Respectant \u00e0 la lettre la p\u00e9dagogie de Maria Montessori, ces petits cahiers simples et attrayants, ne poursuivant qu'un seul objectif \u00e0 la fois, offrent une progression rigoureuse et structur\u00e9e aux enfants. La p\u00e9riode sensible du langage. Tous les enfants traversent la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle ils se montrent sensibles au langage sous ses diff\u00e9rents aspects. Avant 3 ans, ils acqui\u00e8rent progressivement, par impr\u00e9gnation, le vocabulaire puis la syntaxe de la langue. A partir de 3 ans, ils s'int\u00e9ressent au langage \u00e9crit, aux lettres, aux sons et aux mots. Enfin, vers l'\u00e2ge de 6 ans, ils d\u00e9couvrent la grammaire, c'est-\u00e0-dire la nature des mots et leur r\u00f4le dans la phrase. Cependant, chaque enfant n'\u00e9prouve pas ce besoin d'apprendre au m\u00eame moment ni avec la m\u00eame intensit\u00e9. Il est donc important de mettre \u00e0 leur disposition des outils progressifs et adapt\u00e9s qui leur permettront de satisfaire leur p\u00e9riode sensible.", "categories": "Children's Books - Education & Reference", "year": "2017", "publisher": "LIB DES ECOLES", "language": "french", "pages": "64", "ISBN13": "9782369401179", "file": "PDF, 10.00 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/17193447", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/17193447/c5c81a"},

Does everyone else seem to speak another language? What can you do to make the grade? If these are the kind of questions you are asking, then this is the book you need. After the excitement of being accepted, the reality of life at university or college can be daunting, but help is at hand. This practical book guides new students through the terminology used at university and shows you: what a student needs to know how to be accepted by students and lecturers how to get the best out of your institution and yourself how to communicate using appropriate language in higher education institutions how to learn the conventions of your specific subject area how to be confident and competent in your new world All new students find the move to university slightly bewildering, but with this book you can be one step ahead. The author has spent time talking to students across a broad range of different universities and uses her first-hand experience as a basis for the book.  Understanding University provides a lifeline for new students in further and higher education offering everything from practical advice on studying, to explanations of frequently used terms. If you don't know the difference between a seminar and a tutorial or want to know what 'matriculation' means, then this is where to start. Need a little assistance? Just open this book.

Later on, a similar reasoning has been applied to algebroid functions, subharmonic functions and meromorphic functions on Riemann surfaces as well as to - alytic functions of several complex variables, holomorphic and meromorphic mappings and to the theory of minimal surfaces. Moreover, several appli- tions of the theory have been exploited, including complex differential and functional equations, complex dynamics and Diophantine equations. The main emphasis of this collection is to direct attention to a number of recently developed novel ideas and generalizations that relate to the - velopment of value distribution theory and its applications. In particular, we mean a recent theory that replaces the conventional consideration of counting within a disc by an analysis of their geometric locations. Another such example is presented by the generalizations of the second main theorem to higher dimensional cases by using the jet theory. Moreover, s- ilar ideas apparently may be applied to several related areas as well, such as to partial differential equations and to differential geometry. Indeed, most of these applications go back to the problem of analyzing zeros of certain complex or real functions, meaning in fact to investigate level sets or level surfaces.", "categories": "Children's Books - Education & Reference", "year": "2004", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Springer US", "language": "english", "pages": "333 / 342", "ISBN10": "1402079516", "ISBN13": "9781402079504", "file": "PDF, 5.41 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/644554", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/644554/335777"},

Why does his daughter Jenny roam barefoot through the wilds, when she should be in school? When did the mysterious white goat begin to patrol the hillside? What is the secret project that J.J.'s son Donal is attempting? And who is the ghost guarding the stone beacon at the top of the mountain\u2014and why has Jenny befriended him?   Finding answers to these questions will take J.J. and his family on the most important and dangerous journey of their lives.

But no matter how hard she tries to forget about magic, it always seems to find her -- even when she's on vacation! When Theodora's biologist-dad is called to the Scottish island of Scornsay to study a scale believed to be from a previously unknown species, Theodora is thrilled to be invited along. A nice vacation is just what she needs to forget all about wyverns, demons, and magical tunnels through time.   But as soon as Theodora sees the scale, she knows it's not from a fish, a reptile, or anything known to science. It's from a dragon, and as Theodora knows all too well, wherever there are dragons, there are wizards, and then there's sure to be trouble. Before she can solve the mystery of the dragon's scale, Theodora will have to confront her own magical heritage and make a perilous journey to the wizard's limbo known as Never-Was.   The Dragon of Never-Was, the sequel to Hatching Magic, is just as funny, witty, and richly imagined as its predecessor. Filled with eccentric characters, crafty dragons, dazzling spells, good friends, and a feisty heroine that readers will root for, this is a middle-grade fantasy to be savored.", "categories": "Children's Books - Fairy Tales, Folk Tales & Myths", "year": "2008", "publisher": "Atheneum Books for Young Readers", "language": "english", "pages": "155", "ISBN10": "1416954538", "ISBN13": "9781416954538", "file": "PDF, 389 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1091641", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1091641/3d9771"},

Soon a mysterious trio arrives to take him away: the explorer Umber, the shy archer Sophie, and Oates, whose strength and honesty are both brutal. Hap and his new acquaintances narrowly escape the cavernous underworld and make their way to Lord Umber's bustling jewel of a harbor city, Kurahaven.   Once there, Hap learns that Lord Umber is an extraordinary man -- he's a merchant, adventurer, inventor, royal adviser, and chronicler of all things monstrous and magical. But Umber's accomplishments can't answer the question closest to the boy's heart: Who is Happenstance?   Desperate to uncover clues in his new, baffling surroundings, Hap accompanies Umber on dangerous and unusual missions. But Hap soon learns that there are powerful enemies inside the kingdom, and a ruthless assassin is hot on his trail. Faced with many unknowns, Hap knows one thing is certain: There's a reason Umber has chosen him...if only he could determine it.   P. W.

As a child in a small rural village in Sierra Leone, Mariatu Kamara lived peacefully surrounded by family and friends. Rumors of rebel attacks were no more than a distant worry.    But when 12-year-old Mariatu set out for a neighboring village, she never arrived. Heavily armed rebel soldiers, many no older than children themselves, attacked and tortured Mariatu. During this brutal act of senseless violence they cut off both her hands.    Stumbling through the countryside, Mariatu miraculously survived. The sweet taste of a mango, her first food after the attack, reaffirmed her desire to live, but the challenge of clutching the fruit in her bloodied arms reinforced the grim new reality that stood before her. With no parents or living adult to support her and living in a refugee camp, she turned to             begging in the streets of Freetown.    In this gripping and heartbreaking true story, Mariatu shares with readers the details of the brutal attack, its aftermath and her eventual arrival in Toronto.

What is a sustainable restaurant? It's one in which as the restaurant grows, the people grow with it.\"\u2014from Behind the Kitchen DoorHow do restaurant workers live on some of the lowest wages in America? And how do poor working conditions\u2014discriminatory labor practices, exploitation, and unsanitary kitchens\u2014affect the meals that arrive at our restaurant tables? Saru Jayaraman, who launched the national restaurant workers' organization Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, sets out to answer these questions by following the lives of restaurant workers in New York City, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Miami, Detroit, and New Orleans.Blending personal narrative and investigative journalism, Jayaraman shows us that the quality of the food that arrives at our restaurant tables depends not only on the sourcing of the ingredients. Our meals benefit from the attention and skill of the people who chop, grill, saut\u00e9, and serve. Behind the Kitchen Door is a groundbreaking exploration of the political, economic, and moral implications of dining out. Jayaraman focuses on the stories of individuals, like Daniel, who grew up on a farm in Ecuador and sought to improve the conditions for employees at Del Posto; the treatment of workers behind the scenes belied the high-toned Slow Food ethic on display in the front of the house.Increasingly, Americans are choosing to dine at restaurants that offer organic, fair-trade, and free-range ingredients for reasons of both health and ethics. Yet few of these diners are aware of the working conditions at the restaurants themselves. But whether you eat haute cuisine or fast food, the well-being of restaurant workers is a pressing concern, affecting our health and safety, local economies, and the life of our communities. Highlighting the roles of the 10 million people, many immigrants, many people of color, who bring their passion, tenacity, and vision to the American dining experience, Jayaraman sets out a bold agenda to raise the living standards of the nation's second-largest private sector workforce\u2014and ensure that dining out is a positive experience on both sides of the kitchen door.", "categories": "Children's Books - Geography & Cultures", "year": "2013", "publisher": "ILR Press", "language": "english", "pages": "208", "ISBN10": "0801451728", "ISBN13": "9780801451720", "file": "EPUB, 766 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2069623/786f35"},

Kimsey", "Richard M. Bohart", "Herg\u00e9"], "rating": "0", "description": "The Adventures of Tintin (Les Aventures de Tintin) is a series of comic strips created by Belgian artist Herge the pen name of Georges Remi (1907 1983). The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingtieme, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.", "categories": "Children's Books - Geography & Cultures", "year": "1980", "edition": "French Edition", "publisher": "Casterman", "language": "french", "pages": "65", "ISBN10": "2203001194", "ISBN13": "9782203001190", "file": "PDF, 26.32 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1060454", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1060454/a663de"},

We watch the twins as they spot a polar bear while coasting on their sleds, then join with the villagers in the sharing of the meat and the feasting afterwards. Among the other activities they enjoy are ice fishing, building a snow house, hunting for seals, and traveling by boat to their summering ground where they catch salmon to dry for the winter.

During all this time, they have told stories to each other to explain how things came to be, to pass on lessons about life, and to describe the mountains, animals, plants, and spirits around them. The Origin of the Milky Way and Other Living Stories of the Cherokee collects 26 stories that are great for kids and are still being told by storytellers today. Presented by members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in their own words, the stories appear in free-verse form, like poems on the page, so that if you read them aloud, you can hear the rhythm of the stories as they were originally told. Barbara R. Duncan provides a helpful introduction that describes Cherokee people's past and present ways of life and their storytelling traditions. The book also includes a glossary of key words from the stories, suggestions for further reading, and notes on the storytellers. For young readers, for parents to read aloud to young listeners, and for teachers and libraries, The Origin of the Milky Way provides an excellent introduction to Cherokee culture.

In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.

Em was sure there couldn't be anything worse than being a brainiac the body of a teenaged supermodel.  But it turned out she was wrong. Because that supermodel could turn out to have a mother who's gone mysteriously missing, a brother who's shown up on her doorstep demanding answers, a former best friend who's intent on destroying Stark Enterprises to avenge the death of his lost love, and a British heartthrob who's written a song about her that's topping the charts.  How can Em balance all that with school, runway shows, and weekend jaunts to St. Johns - especially when she's got ex-boyfriends crawling out of the woodwork who want more than just a photo op; a sister who is headed to the high school cheerleading championships; a company she represents that seems to be turning to the dark side...

Wondrous gifts: the ability--with a glance, a gesture, a word--to summon animals, bring forth fire, move the land. Fearsome gifts: They can twist a limb, chain a mind, inflict a wasting illness. The Uplanders live in constant fear that one family might unleash its gift against another. Two young people, friends since childhood, decide not to use their gifts. One, a girl, refuses to bring animals to their death in the hunt. The other, a boy, wears a blindfold lest his eyes and his anger kill. In this beautifully crafted story, Ursula K. Le Guin writes of the proud cruelty of power, of how hard it is to grow up, and of how much harder still it is to find, in the world's darkness, gifts of light.

Alyson is a forty-something, suburbanite, working-mother of two and can speak to these issues both personally and professionally.This book explains the psycho-social phenomena of how each person creates their own unique \"good mother myth\" and then examines why these myths are not only faulty, but could in fact lead to poor parenting, marital disaster and individual crisis. Her years of educating parents around these concepts afford Alyson the skill to take complex ideas and explain them to a lay audience in a compelling and easy to understand way.Capitalizing on the need to present parents with information in an easy to digest format, the book is presented as a series of personal stories, each highlighting a common parenting myth. This format will appeal to tired parents who have little time and energy for \"academia\". Instead, readers learn by taking a voyeuristic peek into the private family lives of the book's characters. Readers can identify with the fictitious parents and coaching clients in the stories and see first hand how the characters \u2019 life experiences shaped their unique \"good mother myths\" and how these myths create conflict in their lives.The author offers up ideas for how the character can reject her current thinking and adopt a more useful outlook to improve her situation. The story arc allows readers to identify and then project how their parenting may be unknowingly going off the rails.The goal of this book is to provide parents with some basic education and a means of self-discovery. Readers uncover their own good mother myths and are given an eye-opening glimpse into potential issues to challenge their thinking. A great sense of empowerment is restored as mothers become better able to resist the pulls of their personal and cultural myths, and instead begin parenting with greater intention and in ways that are more suitable to proper child guidance.", "categories": "Children's Books - Growing Up & Facts of Life", "year": "2006", "edition": "1", "language": "english", "pages": "224", "ISBN10": "0470837438", "ISBN13": "9780470158425", "file": "PDF, 1.25 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/952244", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/952244/12f2ca"},

Dear Fellow-Parents,Once Upon a Potty is best used as a companion volume to a child's new potty. I wrote this book when my own child was toilet training to help him better understand the process. My son was encouraged and excited by this story. It motivated him to make the developmental leap from diaper to potty. Learning to use the potty is often a lengthy process, taxing the patience of both parent and child. When success finally comes -- and it should come in its own good time, without undue pressure or haste -- it enhances the child's confidence and pride. She has taken another step toward independence. She sat on the potty as a little child and got up feeling ten-feet tall. It's one small step for mankind, but a giant one for your family.

After the Muslims recapture Jerusalem, three great kings of Europe vow to regain the Holy City: King Richard the Lionhearted of England, King Philip of France, and the Emperor Frederick of Germany.  Despite winning many battles in this third crusade and capturing the city of Acre, they fail to win back the city of Jerusalem.  King Louis of France launches the last crusade, but dies before achieving his objective.  Throughout the narrative we meet all sorts of men.

Indeed, Megargee argues, the German high command was much more flawed than many have suspected or acknowledged. Inside Hitler's High Command reveals that while Hitler was the central figure in many military decisions, his generals were equal partners in Germany's catastrophic defeat.Megargee exposes the structure, processes, and personalities that governed the Third Reich's military decision making and shows how Germany's presumed battlefield superiority was undermined by poor strategic and operational planning at the highest levels. His study tracks the evolution of German military leadership under the Nazis from 1933 to 1945 and expands our understanding of the balance of power within the high command, the role of personalities in its organizational development, and the influence of German military intellectuals on its structure and function. He also shows how the organization of the high command was plagued by ambition, stubbornness, political intrigue, and overworked staff officers. And his \"a week in the life\" chapter puts the high command under a magnifying glass to reveal its inner workings during the fierce fighting on the Russian Front in December 1941.In the final assessment, observes Megargee, the generals' strategic ideas were no better than Hitler's and often worse. Heinz Guderian, Franz Halder, and the rest were as guilty of self-deception as their Fuhrer, believing that innate German superiority and strength of will were enough to overcome nearly any obstacle. Inside Hitler's High Command exposes these surprising flaws and illuminates the process of strategy and decision making in the Third Reich.", "categories": "Children's Books - History", "year": "2000", "publisher": "University Press of Kansas", "language": "english", "pages": "347", "ISBN13": "9780700610150", "file": "PDF, 13.94 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/16996409", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16996409/f045eb"},

A whole family sat for hours around the fire in the middle of the room.  That fire gave the only light.  Shadows flitted in the dark corners.  Smoke curled along the  high beams of the ceiling.  The children sat on the dirt floor close by the fire.  The grown people were on a long narrow bench that they had pulled up to the light and warmth.  Everybody's hands were busy with wool.  As the family worked in the red fire-light, the father told of the kings of Norway, of long voyages to strange lands, of good fights.  And in farmhouses all through Iceland these old tales were told over and over until everybody knew them and loved them.  Men who could sing and play the harp were called \"skalds,\" and they called their songs \"sagas.\"  Eventually these stories were written down on sheepskin or vellum so that we can enjoy them today.    We follow the fortunes of Harald from the time he is acknowledged by his father as a baby and given his own thrall at the cutting of his first tooth, through his exploits as a viking adventurer, to his crowning as King of Norway.  It is when Harald is King of Norway that population pressures at home and eagerness for adventure and booty from other lands combine to drive some of the bolder Vikings to set forth from their native land.  Sailing ever westward across the Atlantic, they hop along the chain of islands that loosely connects Norway with America-Orkneys and Shetlands, Faeroes, Iceland, and Greenland.  It is from link to link of this chain that the characters in our story sail in search of home and adventure.  Discoveries are made by accident.  Ships are driven by the wind into unknown ports, resulting in landings and settlements in Iceland, Greenland, and America.  The crude courage of these men and strangeness of their adventures appeal strongly to children, while their love of truth, hardy endurance, and faithfulness to the promised word make them characters to emulate.

With her magical powers, she tricks Hercules into performing a series of twelve seemingly impossible labors, each one a test of his strength, courage, cunning, and fighting skill. Is Hercules strong enough to foil her scheme? For this exciting retelling of the twelve labors, author Paul Storrie consulted the classic work The Age of Fable (1859), by American Thomas Bulfinch, and Edith Hamilton's Mythology (1942), both of which are considered the best resources about on ancient myths and legends.

Hot metal illuminates connections between design, material culture and labour between the 1960s and the 1980s, when the traditional crafts of hot-metal typesetting and letterpress were finally made obsolete with the introduction of computerised technologies. This multidisciplinary history provides an evocative rendering of design culture by exploring an intriguing case: a doggedly traditional Government Printing Office in Australia. It explores the struggles experienced by printers as they engaged in technological retraining, shortly before facing factory closure.\u00a0Topics explored include spatial memory within oral history, gender-labour tensions, the rise of neoliberalism and the secret making of objects 'on the side'. This book will appeal to researchers in design and social history, labour history, material culture and gender studies. It is an accessible, richly argued text that will benefit students seeking to learn about the nature and erosion of blue-collar work and the history of printing as a craft.", "categories": "Children's Books - History", "year": "2016", "publisher": "Manchester University Press", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9781784994341", "file": "PDF, 4.48 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/16999412", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16999412/3d17ee"},

From the original influx of Protestants to subsequent waves of Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and devotees of Santeria and Voudou, Jenna Weissman Joselit describes the struggle to establish traditions in the New World, oftentimes in the face of considerable hostility and prejudice. The impact of intolerance, the U.S. government's various policies on immigration, and the effects of two World Wars all play a significant part in this fascinating narrative.

Why do some cities have many Black leaders with multi-racial appeal while other cities have none? Subordination or Empowerment answers these questions through detailed historical examinations of the Black struggle for political power in Chicago, Gary, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. Keiser argues that electoral competition among White factions has created opportunities for Black leaders to win genuine political empowerment and avoid subordination. When electoral competition among Whites does not exist, Black votes lose their electoral leverage, leading to the rise of extra-electoral strategies. Keiser's dynamic theory of leadership formation explains the current appeal of Black separatism and messianism at the local and national levels and the consequent rise of leaders such as Louis Farakhan, and offers a rejoinder to Cornel West's critique of Black leadership in Race Matters.", "categories": "Children's Books - History", "year": "1997", "publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "language": "english", "pages": "256 / 255", "ISBN10": "0195075692", "ISBN13": "9781429415385", "file": "PDF, 18.72 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1071079", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1071079/14ff2e"},

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingtieme, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.", "categories": "Children's Books - Literature & Fiction", "year": "1975", "language": "english", "pages": "62 / 64", "ISBN10": "082885016X", "ISBN13": "9780828850162", "file": "PDF, 29.73 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/862808", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/862808/b7736a"},

At first, Maggie is just feeling stubborn when she declares she won't learn cursive. What's wrong with print, anyway? And she can easily type on a computer, so why would she need to know how to read those squiggly lines? But soon all her classmates are buzzing about Maggie's decision, especially after her teacher, Mrs. Leeper, says Maggie's cursive is so sloppy that her name looks like \"Muggie.\" With \"Muggie Maggie\" ringing in her ears, Maggie absolutely, positively won't back down...until she's appointed class mail messenger. All the letters that Mrs. Leeper sends to the office are in cursive, and Maggie thinks they are written about her. But there's only way to know for sure...so what's Maggie going to do? For generations, Beverly Cleary has captivated readers of all ages with beloved characters such as Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, Ribsy, and Ralph S. Mouse. Muggie Maggie follows suit with what School Library Journal calls \"a likable, funny heroine whom readers will want to know.\"", "categories": "Children's Books - Literature & Fiction", "year": "2009", "edition": "Reissue", "publisher": "HarperCollins", "language": "english", "pages": "96", "ISBN13": "9780061972287", "file": "EPUB, 896 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1905456/b937f5"},

Often what they read were popular magazines aimed at the whole family; a weekly newspaper such as The Youth\u2019s Companion or a monthly magazine like St. Nicholas were about all a turn-of-the-century family could afford. But what these publications afforded was invaluable, and it is this education in imagination and American life that Adventures in the West revisits.\u00a0Adventures in the West brings together twenty-six stories from The Youth\u2019s Companion and St. Nicholas to offer a unique perspective on the values of the time. The stories also reveal the common myths, attitudes, and prejudices of life on the western frontier, reflected in the lessons these publications imparted to a young audience. To enhance the reader\u2019s understanding, the editors have added historical and cultural background for each story. Some of the best writers of the time, including L. Frank Baum, Hamlin Garland, and Mary Austin, write of a West that mirrors American history and the values the authors sought to promote. Filled with the exploits of cowpunchers, pioneers, courageous Indians, and plucky animals, these riveting stories also embody the beliefs and experiences of an era and tell more than one story of their day.

Inspired by the bunch of violets and cuckoo-buds Gabriel brings into the workroom, Brother Stephen conceives a new idea for an illuminated border.  Instead of painting the border with scrolls and birds and flowers in the conventional way, he would decorate the book with borders of gold on which he would paint in realistic fashion the meadow wildflowers, and bees and butterflies, and all the little flying creatures.  As Brother Stephen's color grinder, Gabriel makes the ink, grinds the gold, gathers the flowers, and prepares the colors for him.  After the book is completed, Gabriel slips into the book a sheet on which he has penned a prayer  to Lady Anne:  \"I, Gabriel Viaud, am Brother Stephen's colour-grinder; and I have made the ink for this book, and the glue, and caught the eels, and ground the gold and colours, and ruled the lines and gathered the flowers for the borders, and so I pray the Lord God will be kind and let my father out of prison in Count Pierre's castle, and tell Count Pierre to give us back our meadow and sheep, for we cannot pay the tax, and mother says we will starve.\"   How his prayer is answered unfolds in the ensuing chapters.     Evaleen Stein brings the medieval world to life for younger students through her stories set in the Middle Ages.  A century ago when this book was first published, a reviewer in the Louisville Daily Courier wrote, \"No works in juvenile fiction contain so many of the elements that stir the hearts of children and grown-ups as well as do the stories so admirably told by this author.\"", "categories": "Children's Books - Literature & Fiction", "year": "2005", "publisher": "Yesterday's Classics", "language": "english", "pages": "100", "ISBN10": "1599150425", "ISBN13": "9781599150420", "file": "EPUB, 507 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/890322/7f2edc"},

The Prefect of the City of Rome seeks his help to solve a series of murders that no one has been able to solve in the month since they were committed. There were three murders in three days.

It will drive hundreds of thousands from their homes, many never to return. An earthquake of historical destructive power suddenly strikes from an unknown fault line in California, leaving in its wake the second most costly natural disaster in U.S. history. A flood, the like of which has not been seen for 500 years, ravages the Midwest United States, ruining crops and towns. Bizarre weather afflicts multitudes of people with hundreds of tornados striking in what is described as the \"worst weather in U.S. history,\" immediately followed by a European heat wave described as the worst in the last 250 years. Terrorists successfully strike in another \"day of infamy,\" and the entire financial structure of the world is shaken to its core as once mighty institutions begin to crumble. All of these terrible events would appear on the surface to be random acts of God. But, were they?        The Israel Omen considers a series of historically destructive events since 1991, connected by a common thread: warnings found in ancient Hebrew writings. Are these events perhaps the telling signs of an ancient omen, the same omen ignored by Egypt some 3500 years ago resulting in the famous Biblical plagues? Did this omen return with the homecoming of the Jews to the Holy Land in 1948?      As the nations of the world gather to remove the restored \"Promised Land\" from the Jews, the international group called the \"Quartet\" leading the effort eerily appears to be specifically mentioned in these ancient writings.

You will meet the embodiment of the law, of sin, and the world system\u2026even the personification of Death as he arrives on the scene to claim his victim.

Released over a period of five years, Lloyd Alexander's beautifully written tales not only captured children's imaginations but also garnered the highest critical praise.

He chooses the village elder's daughter, sixteen-year-old Sydelle Mirabel, who is a skilled weaver and has an unusual knack for repairing his magical cloaks. Though Sydelle has dreamt of escaping her home, she's hurt that her parents relinquish her so freely and finds herself awed and afraid of the slightly ragtag wizard who is unlike any of the men of magic in the tales she's heard. Still, she is drawn to this mysterious man who is fiercely protective of her and so reluctant to share his own past. The pair rushes toward the capital, intent to stop an imminent war, pursued by Reuel Dorwan (a dark wizard who has taken a keen interest in Sydelle) and plagued by unusually wild weather. But the sudden earthquakes and freak snowstorms may not be a coincidence. As Sydelle discovers North's dark secret and the reason for his interest in her and learns to master her own mysterious power, it becomes increasingly clear that the fate of the kingdom rests in her fingertips. She will either be a savior, weaving together the frayed bonds between Saldorra and Auster, or the disastrous force that destroys both kingdoms forever.", "categories": "Children's Books - Science, Nature & How It Works", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Egmont USA", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "1606840614", "ISBN13": "9781606840610", "file": "EPUB, 2.24 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1171676/761e37"},

In a few short years, he made astounding discoveries in physics, astronomy, optics, and mathematics\u0097 yet never told a soul. Though isolated, snobbish, and jealous, he almost single-handedly changed the course of scientific advancement and ushered in the Enlightenment. Newton invented the refracting telescope, explained the motion of planets and comets, discovered the multicolored nature of light, and created an entirely new field of mathematical understanding: calculus. The world might have been a very different place had Netwon\u2019s theories and observations not been coaxed out of him by his colleagues.\u00a0Isaac Newton and Physics for Kids paints a rich portrait of this brilliant and complex man, including 21 hands-on projects that explore the scientific concepts Newton developed and the times in which he lived. Readers will build a simple waterwheel, create a 17thcentury plague mask, track the phases of the moon, and test Newton\u2019s Three Laws of Motion using coins, a skateboard, and a model boat they construct themselves. The text includes a time line, online resources, and reading list for further study.

In a world where everyone is born with wings, stone monsters prowl the skies, hunting those who dare to fly too high.In the Clandoms, everyone is born with wings, with tight-knit communities formed around bird types: Jay, Falcon, Crow. Ellie Meadows dreams of growing up to join the Goldwings -- the famed knights who defend all the people of the Clandoms. It was a Goldwing, after all, who saved her life on that terrible day her parents were killed. There's just one problem: Ellie is a Sparrow, and the Goldwings are almost invariably picked from the higher clans like Eagles and Ospreys. This rigid hierarchy means that Ellie is destined to become a farmer. Determined to honor her parents' memories and prove herself worthy of the Goldwings, Ellie sets out on her own for the capital. But her journey will be dangerous. Foul creatures called gargols lurk behind every cloud, ready to slay anyone unlucky enough to be caught outside in a storm -- just as Ellie's family was. Soon her path intertwines with a colorful band of fellow outcasts, each with their own aspirations... and their own secrets. Ellie's new friends offer not just roadside companionship.
