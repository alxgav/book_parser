At the age of twenty-six he chose to become a Trappist monk and began to pursue his ultimate, lifelong passion. From his austere quarters at Our Lady of Gethsemani Abbey in Trappist, Kentucky, Merton worked to change the world and to come closer to his God. The drawings and prayers in this volume are the intimate, beautifully rendered record of that pursuit -- Merton's dialogue with God. The prayers have been gathered from all of Merton's writings -- his books, journals, letters -- and are collected here, along with his largely unknown drawings, for the first time.In his drawings we see the evolution of Merton's art from purely representational to the more abstract, reflecting his interest in Zen andEastern cultures. It is easy to see that art was in his genes; both of his parents were artists. With each prayer and in every brushstroke, we sensethe depth of Merton's passion as we pause and incline our ear to his voice offering these heartfelt songs to God and to the world. Dialogues with Silenceinvites the reader to enter into that sacred realm of contemplation where we listen in silence and await the divine presence in our lives, where emptiness becomes the juncture for the interchange between the outer and inner worlds, where darkness is transformed into light -- the place where the voice of God is revealed.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2001", "edition": "1st", "language": "english", "pages": "208 / 215", "ISBN10": "0060656034", "ISBN13": "9780061464522", "file": "PDF, 2.05 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/837610", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/837610/e572da"},

Author Charles Bouleau explores a tremendous variety of ancient and modern works: the Parthenon friezes, Italian mosaics, the Bayeux Tapestry, and Gothic stonemasons' marks of France and Germany as well as paintings by Picasso, Kandinsky, Klee, and Pollock. His insightful expositions cast new light on such well-known works as Raphael's \"The School of Athens,\" Botticelli's \"Birth of Venus,\" Rubens' \"Descent from the Cross,\" and Renoir's \"Le Moulin de la Galette.\"Advancing step by step through each painter's vast body of work, the survey highlights new contributions from each period and artist. Every analysis is conducted according to strict methods, placing the work within the intellectual atmosphere of its time. Original, informative, and stimulating, The Painter's Secret Geometry reveals the framework of art as well as its most profound and secret poetry.

Seine ersten weltweiten Aufruf zum Ruhm war das Ergebnis seiner kunstvollen und makabre Gestaltung des Raumes Kreatur in dem Film, Alien, sein Erfolg kein Zweifel, angetrieben ins Licht der \u00d6ffentlichkeit durch das meistverkaufte Buch Necronomicon Kunst. F\u00fcr seine Arbeit in Alien erhielt er einen Oscar im Jahr 1980.  Die Motive von Geburt, Tod und Sex sind die vorherrschenden Themen der Giger \\ \\ \\ s art. Tschechisch / amerikanische Psychiater Stanislav Grof, der Ansicht, dass Tod und Sex sind eng miteinander verkn\u00fcpft, vor allem in der Zeit rund um die Geburt. In seinem Buch The Cosmic Game, ruft Grof diese Dreieinigkeit von Themen, wichtige Routen zu Transzendenz und Spiritualit\u00e4t. Er glaubt, dass es tiefe Verbindung zwischen den drei - eine kosmische Verbindung - die es uns erm\u00f6glichen, mit der Quelle unseres Seins wieder zu vereinen k\u00f6nnen.  Dr. Grof schreibt, dass es verst\u00e4ndlich ist, warum Geburt und Tod eng in der menschlichen Psyche verbunden sind, da seit \u00c4onen gab es die allgegenw\u00e4rtige Gefahr des F\u00f6tus und / oder Mutter sterben w\u00e4hrend der Geburt.

In each lesson, you'll learn how the two-pencil method can add depth and shading, allowing you to create bold and distinctive drawings that go beyond mere sketchbook doodles. The book moves from a primer on drawing basics to step-by-step examples of still lifes, landscapes, animals, travel sketches, and portraits. With each chapter, Crilley's confident and encouraging voice and expert insights demonstrate how to achieve stunning artistic results from the simplest of art materials.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2018", "publisher": "Watson-Guptill Publications", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9780399581267", "file": "EPUB, 126.36 MB", "preview_link": "", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3686268/072a92"},

Beset by lists of content standards and accompanying ''high-stakes'' accountability tests, many educators sense that both teaching and learning have been redirected in ways that are potentially impoverishing for those who teach and those who learn. Educators need a model that acknowledges the centrality of standards but also ensures that students truly understand content and can apply it in meaningful ways. For many educators, Understanding by Design addresses that need.Simultaneously, teachers find it increasingly difficult to ignore the diversity of the learners who populate their classrooms. Few teachers find their work effective or satisfying when they simply ''serve up'' a curriculum--even an elegant one--to students with no regard for their varied learning needs. For many educators, Differentiated Instruction offers a framework for addressing learner variance as a critical component of instructional planning.In this book the two models converge, providing readers fresh perspectives on two of the greatest contemporary challenges for educators: crafting powerful curriculum in a standards-dominated era and ensuring academic success for the full spectrum of learners. Each model strengthens the other. Understanding by Design is predominantly a curriculum design model that focuses on what we teach. Differentiated Instruction focuses on  whom  we teach,  where  we teach, and  how  we teach. Carol Ann Tomlinson and Jay McTighe show you how to use the principles of backward design and differentiation together to craft lesson plans that will teach essential knowledge and skills for the full spectrum of learners.Connecting content and kids in meaningful ways is what teachers strive to do every day. In tandem, UbD and DI help educators meet that goal by providing structures, tools, and guidance for developing curriculum and instruction that bring to students the best of what we know about effective teaching and learning.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2006", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "ASCD", "language": "english", "pages": "209", "ISBN10": "1416602844", "ISBN13": "9781416603740", "file": "PDF, 1.48 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/697398", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/697398/52dafe"},

The second part contains the lithographs that Bargue made after master drawings by Renaissance and moderns artists and the third section almost 60 exemplary drawings of nude male models.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2003", "edition": "2", "publisher": "ACR Edition", "language": "english", "pages": "214", "ISBN13": "9782867701665", "file": "PDF, 66.68 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2730174", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2730174/8fa76c"},

They are naturally adaptable enough to meet an incredibly wide range of communication needs. But how exactly do they do their job so well?    Avoiding the kinds of aesthetic rankings of different graphic domains so often made by art historians and critics, Manfredo Massironi considers an extensive and representative sample of graphic applications with an open mind. He finds a deep mutuality between the material components of images and the activation of the perceptual and cognitive processes that create and decipher them.    Massironi first examines the material components themselves: the mark or line, the plane of representation (the angle formed by the actual drawing surface and the depicted objects), and the position of the viewpoint relative to the depicted objects. The roles played by these three components are independent of the content of the drawing; they function in the same way in concrete and abstract representations. He then closely scrutinizes the choices made by the person planning and executing the drawings. Given that any object can be depicted in an infinite number of different ways, the drawer performs continuous work emphasizing and excluding different features. The choices are typically unconscious and guided by his or her communicative goals. A successful graph, be it simple or complex, is always successful precisely because the emphasized features are far fewer in number than the excluded ones. Finally, he analyzes the perceptual and cognitive integrations made by the viewer.    Drawings are not simply tools for communication but important instruments for investigating reality and its structure. Richly illustrated, the book includes a series of graphic exercises that enable readers to get a sense of their own perceptual and cognitive activity when inspecting images. Massironi's pathbreaking taxonomy of graphic productions will illuminate all the processes involved in producing and understanding graphic images for a wide audience, in fields ranging from perceptual and cognitive psychology through human factors and graphic design to architecture and art history.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2001", "publisher": "Psychology Press", "language": "english", "pages": "330", "ISBN10": "0805829326", "ISBN13": "9780805829334", "file": "PDF, 58.46 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/684049", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/684049/0b9acb"},

This book traces the artist\u2019s successive triumphs as a draftsman, first in the Netherlands and later in France, highlighting the diversity of his technical invention and the striking continuity of his vision. Given the pivotal role drawings played in Van Gogh\u2019s artistic conception and the rich dialectic they enjoyed with his oil paintings, a small selection of related canvases by the artist is also featured.\r\nThis beautiful book presents approximately 120 works in charcoal, ink, graphite, watercolor, and diluted oils. The authors explore enduring questions that surround Van Gogh\u2019s drawings, including their manufacture, artistic precedents, and contribution to Modernism. In addition, the text discusses the significance of the artist\u2019s drawing practice to his development as a painter. The essays and entries feature the most current research on Van Gogh\u2019s drawings and provide fresh interpretations of the motivating influences that shaped the artist\u2019s contributions to the history of drawing.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2005", "publisher": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art", "language": "english", "pages": "392 / 394", "ISBN10": "1588391647", "ISBN13": "9781588391643", "file": "PDF, 90.77 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/2191049", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/2191049/e7fa8c"},

They assess recent experimental trends and explore the functions of orality, ethnicity, and power in ethnographic composition. Writing Culture argues that ethnography is in the midst of a political and epistemological crisis: Western writers no longer portray non-Western peoples with unchallenged authority; the process of cultural representation is now inescapably contingent, historical, and contestable.

This could be one reason why coloring is such a treasured pastime for children. It allows them the opportunity to express the beauty in the small details that they notice every day.  Fortunately, there has been a recent increase of interest in coloring for adults as well, and I believe that the appreciation for the beauty that we sometimes neglect is one reason that this is so. Along with this, adult coloring brings an opportunity for self expression and relaxation without any long term commitment. It can be done alone or with friends, with the simplest of tools or the most elaborate. As adults, we gain something even richer and more satisfying from coloring, especially when the images are intricately beautiful and inspiring.

Traditional methods of measuring body proportions rely on the abstract memorization of convoluted fractions or multiples of the human head. But artists shouldn't have to be mathematicians. Figure Drawing in Proportion introduces a better, more intuitive, less intimidating way to get proportions right. It starts with the revelation that--despite the wonderful variety of bodies in this world--the human figure has standard size relationships artists can build upon for accurate renderings. If you know, for example, that the collarbone is the same width as the head, it's much easier to draw the head in proper relationship to the shoulders. Knowing that the palm should be the same width as the knee helps establish the correct relationships in a seated portrait. This book highlights dozens of such key internal and comparative measurements. Once you start looking, you will discover even more. Ideal for any level of artist, this practical approach to proportions makes figure drawing more approachable and more rewarding.

Everyone knows that whatever the skin color, nationality, or religion, every human being uses the same tools for perception, for memory, and for reasoning. Everyone knows that a logically true statement is true in English, German, or Hindi. Everyone knows that when a Chinese and an American look at the same painting, they see the same painting.  But what if everyone is wrong?  When psychologist Richard E. Nisbett showed an animated underwater scene to his American students, they zeroed in on a big fish swimming among smaller fish. Japanese subjects, on the other hand, made observations about the background environment -- and the different \"seeings\" are a clue to profound underlying cognitive differences between Westerners and East Asians. For, as Professor Nisbett shows in The Geography of Thought, people actually think about -- and even see -- the world differently because of differing ecologies, social structures, philosophies, and educational systems that date back to ancient Greece and China and that have survived into the modern world. As a result, East Asian thought is \"holistic\" -- drawn to the perceptual field as a whole and to relations among objects and events within that field. By comparison to Western modes of reasoning, East Asian thought relies far less on categories or on formal logic; it is fundamentally dialectic, seeking a \"middle way\" between opposing thoughts. By contrast, Westerners focus on salient objects or people, use attributes to assign them to catergories, and apply rules of formal logic to understand their behavior.    The Geography of Thought documents Professor Nisbett's groundbreaking international research in cultural psychology, a series of comparative studies both persuasive in their rigor and startling in their conclusions, addressing questions such as:  \u2022 Why did the ancient Chinese excel at algebra and arithmetic, but not geometry, the brilliant achievement of such Greeks as Euclid?  \u2022 Why do East Asians find it so difficult to disentangle an object from its surroundings?  \u2022 Why do Western infants learn nouns more rapidly than verbs, when it is the other way around in East Asia?  \u2022 What are the implications of these cognitive differences for the future of international politics? Do they support a Fukuyamaesque \"end of history\" scenario or a Huntingtonian \"clash of civilizations\"?  From feng shui to metaphysics, from comparative linguistics to economic history, a gulf separates the children of Aristotle from the descendants of Confucius. At a moment in history when the need for cross-cultural understanding and collaboration have never been more important, The Geography of Thought offers both a map to that gulf and a blueprint for a bridge that might be able to span it.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2003", "publisher": "Free Press", "language": "english", "pages": "288 / 275", "ISBN10": "0743216466", "ISBN13": "9780743216463", "file": "PDF, 1.51 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/940403", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/940403/e1097d"},

The first illustrates and describe the basic head structure -- bones, form and proportion -- and the major features on the head. One has to note that Burne Hogarth's drawing for heads are a bit stylised. So they are not 100% realistic in that sense. \rSection 2 is probably why you're buying the book for. Here, a simple model is introduced for drawing heads. It is actually the one that's shown on the cover. It helps to locate features on the head in any angle easily, and makes basic construction from memory a breeze. \rIn section 4, there are drawings of heads from babies to old men, showing the wrinkles and sagging skin. Section 5 talks about head types and presents a gallery of heads highlighting the features of people from different countries. The last section 6 looks at some sculptures and paintings from old masters, interesting but not necessary. \rOverall, this is really a speedy guide to learning head drawing.

Part of the problem \u2014 before this book came along \u2014 was that there was a lack of concise and simple instruction on the subject, and much that was written was too vague to be helpful. This comprehensive, well-illustrated book was created to solve the problem.In these pages George Bridgman \u2014 a longtime instructor at New York's Art Student League and one of the nation's foremost teachers of figure drawing \u2014 offers expert advice on depicting draped figures. \"Clothing is none other than a drapery arranged around a body that is beneath it. To express the multitudinous forms it takes, one should learn to express in a direct way the different characters of folds, for each one plays its individual part as distinctly apart as actors play their different characters upon the stage.\"Students learn the characteristics of seven different kinds of folds and how to render them, including pipe, zigzag, spiral, half-lock, diaper pattern, drop, and inert folds. Mastery of these principles is the key to realistic portrayal of garments, as well as the proper rendering of cloth in still lifes. The straightforward, easy-to-follow text is illustrated by 200 of Bridgman's own sketches and diagrams, reproduced from pencil renderings in crisp halftones. Art students, teachers, and professionals alike are sure to welcome this inexpensive republication of a practical, hands-on manual by a master of figure drawing.", "categories": "Arts - Graphic Arts", "year": "2001", "publisher": "Dover Publications", "language": "english", "ISBN13": "9780486138121", "file": "EPUB, 9.30 MB", "preview_link": "", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3686263/885dd5"},
