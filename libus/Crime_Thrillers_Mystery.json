He attended the Grammar School in Irvine, Scotland for a short period in 1815, before rejoining the family in London in 1816. He studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until the summer of 1817. Best known for his tales of the macabre and mystery, Poe was one of the early American practitioners of the short story and a progenitor of detective fiction and crime fiction. He is also credited with contributing to the emergent science fiction genre. His works have had a broad influence on American and world literature (sometimes even despite those who tried to resist it), and even on the art world beyond literature. The scope of his influence on art is evident when one sees the many and diverse artists who were directly and profoundly influenced by him.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2009", "publisher": "Dodo Press", "language": "english", "pages": "171", "ISBN10": "140994848X", "ISBN13": "9781409948483", "file": "PDF, 714 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1201803", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1201803/9f7146"},

As revealed in Nelson DeMille's monster bestseller Plum Island, the gruff, wisecracking NYPD homicide cop Corey stopped a hail of bullets--but he couldn't stop his wife from walking out on him. Asad, raised under Muammar Qaddafi's eye after his dad's murder, lost his surviving family in the 1986 bombing of Libya. He's heard the nasty rumors about his mom and the colonel, but he aims his rage at the infidels. The boy's got such a gift for terrorism he's earned the nickname ''the Lion,'' and Boris, his vodka-sozzled, sex-addicted +\u00acmigr+\u00ac mentor, knows precisely how to conduct a murder tour of America one step ahead of the police, the FBI, the CIA, and the ATTF (Anti-Terrorist Task Force), which combines members of all three. A pity Boris must die, but hey, he's an infidel too.Asad pretends to defect, handcuffed to agents aboard a 747 bound for JFK, and he proves to be a worse seatmate than a siding salesman. Corey and his ATTF colleagues (most conspicuously the FBI's sexy Kate Mayfield, Corey's match in badinage and bad-guy busting) strive to halt Asad's methodical yet unpredictable bloodbath. Skillfully, DeMille alternates chapters told from Asad's and Corey's points of view. DeMille did his authenticity homework: when we're not savoring his gift for wiseacre dialogue in the Corey-Kate chapters, we're sweating alongside Asad on his ghastly, ingenious jihad. The New York Times put DeMille's social satire on a par with Edith Wharton's, and he's great on the colliding folkways of the feuding, mutually doublecrossing crimebuster institutions. Naturally, he's on the side of the regular-guy flatfoots. ''Cops sit on their asses and flip through their folders,'' he writes. ''Feds sit on their derrieres and peruse their dossiers.'' And the CIA gets it in the shorts, satirically speaking. One deplores the mass murderers, but the book's real bad guys wear the priciest suits.DeMille reportedly has a $25 million book contract. With fast, funny, absorbing thrillers like The Lion's Game, he's earned it. --Tim Appelo", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2002", "publisher": "Grand Central Publishing", "language": "english", "pages": "464", "ISBN10": "0446679097", "file": "EPUB, 850 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/810808/9ddbc0"},

The floodgates have been opened for the smuggling of hundreds of exotic birds, mammals, and reptiles to Western nations, but this crime hides a deeper secret. Amid a hail of bullets, a concealed underground weapons lab is ransacked\u2014and something even more horrific is set free.   Seven years later, Louisiana state veterinarian Lorna Polk stumbles upon a fishing trawler shipwrecked on a barrier island. The crew is missing or dead, but the boat holds a frightening cargo: a caged group of exotic animals, clearly part of a black market smuggling ring.   Yet, something is wrong with these beasts, disturbing deformities that make no sense: a parrot with no feathers, a pair of Capuchin monkeys conjoined at the hip, a jaguar cub with the dentition of a saber-toothed tiger. They also all share one uncanny trait\u2014a disturbingly heightened intelligence.   To uncover the truth about the origin of this strange cargo and the terrorist threat it poses, Lorna must team up with a man who shares a dark and bloody past with her and is now an agent with the U.S. Border Patrol, Jack Menard.   Together, the two must hunt for a beast that escaped the shipwreck while uncovering a mystery tied to fractal science and genetic engineering, all to expose a horrifying secret that traces back to humankind's earliest roots.   But can Lorna stop what is about to be born upon the altar of Eden before it threatens not only the world but also the very foundation of what it means to be human?", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2010", "edition": "1", "publisher": "HarperCollins", "language": "english", "pages": "416", "ISBN10": "0061231428", "ISBN13": "9780061231421", "file": "EPUB, 1.53 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/828983/682d24"},

A series of deadly encounters with an IRA splinter group had brought him to the attention of the CIA's Deputy Director, Vice Admiral James Greer-as well as his counterpart with the British SIS, Sir Basil Charleston-and when Greer asked him if he wanted to come aboard as a freelance analyst, Jack was quick to accept. The opportunity was irresistible, and he was sure he could fit it in with the rest of his work.  And then Jack forgot all about the rest of his work, because one of his first assignments was to help debrief a high-level Soviet defector, and the defector told an amazing tale: Top Soviet officials, including Yuri Andropov, were planning to assassinate the Pope, John Paul II.  Could it be true? As the days and weeks go by, Ryan must battle, first to try to confirm the plot, and then to prevent it, but this is a brave new world, and nothing he has done up to now has prepared him for the lethal game of cat-and-mouse that is the Soviet Union versus the United States. In the end, it will be not just the Pope's life but the stability of the Western world that is at stake. . . and it may already be too late for a novice CIA analyst to do anything about it.  \"Clancy creates not only compelling characters but frighteningly topical situations and heart-stopping action,\" wrote The Washington Post about The Bear and the Dragon. \"Among the handful of superstars, Clancy still reigns, and he is not likely to be dethroned any time soon.\" These words were never truer than about the remarkable pages of his breathtaking new novel.

Then war came crashing down around her, and a daring young South African aviator named Michael Courtney stole her heart amidst the destruction.

But before the new pilots can complete their training, the squadron's base is attacked by former Imperial admiral Trigit, and Wraith Squadron is forced to swing into action--taking over an Imperial warship and impersonating its crew. The mission: to gain vital intelligence about Trigit's secret weapons, to sabotage the admiral's plans, and to lure him into an Alliance trap.

Tonight the city is on edge, a hive of hurried, sometimes violent activity; its citizens bustle about, barring doors, shuttering windows, avoiding any stranger\u2019s stare. Because tonight there is to be a convergence, the once-in-a-generation appearance of a Shadow Moon \u2013 an occasion that threatens the good people of Malaz with demon hounds and other, darker things \u2026 It was also prophesied that this night would witness the return of Emperor Kellanved, and there are those prepared to do anything to prevent this happening. As factions within the greater Empire draw up battle lines over the imperial throne, the Shadow Moon summons a far more ancient and potent presence for an all-out assault upon the island. Witnessing these cataclysmic events are Kiska, a young girl who yearns to flee the constraints of the city, and Temper, a grizzled, battle-weary veteran who seeks simply to escape his past. Each is to play a part in a conflict that will not only determine the fate of Malaz City, but also of the world beyond \u2026 Drawing on events touched on in the prologue of Steven Erikson\u2019s landmark fantasy Gardens of the Moon, Night of Knives is a momentous chapter in the unfolding story of the extraordinarily imagined world of Malaz.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2009", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "Tor Books", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0765323710", "ISBN13": "9780765323712", "file": "EPUB, 351 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1216841/2ce3ff"},

Its annihilation of the planet Alderaan, at the merciless command of Grand Moff Tarkin, lives in infamy. And its own ultimate destruction, at the hands of Luke Skywalker, is the stuff of legend. But what is the whole story, and who are the players, behind the creation of this world-killing satellite of doom?The near extermination of the Jedi order cleared the way for Palpatine\u2013power-hungry Senator and Sith Lord\u2013to seize control of the Republic, declare himself Emperor, and usher in a fearsome, totalitarian regime. But even with the dreaded Darth Vader enforcing Palpatine\u2019s sinister will, the threat of rebellion still looms. And the Emperor knows that only abject fear\u2013and the ability to punish dissent with devastating consequences\u2013can ensure his unchallenged control of the galaxy. Enter ambitious and ruthless government official Wilhuff Tarkin, architect of the Emperor\u2019s terrifying dream come true. From inception to completion, construction of the unprecedented Death Star is awash in the intrigues, hidden agendas, unexpected revelations, and daring gambits of those involved on every level. The brightest minds and boldest egos, the most ambitious and corrupt, the desperate and the devious, all have a stake in the Death Star\u2013and its potential to control the fate of the galaxy.Soldiers and slaves, loyalists and Rebels, spies and avengers, the innocent and the evil\u2013all their paths and fates will cross and intertwine as the Death Star moves from its maiden voyage to its final showdown. And a shadowy chapter of Star Wars history is stunningly illuminated in a thrilling, unforgettable adventure.From the Hardcover edition.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2008", "edition": "Reprint", "publisher": "LucasBooks", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "034547743X", "ISBN13": "9780345477439", "file": "EPUB, 385 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1196074/bfde19"},

In the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England, gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking. And law in the New World is made by those who take it into their hands.  Word in port is that the Spanish treasure galleon El Trinidad, fresh from New Spain, is stalled in nearby Matanceros harbor awaiting repairs. Heavily fortified, the impregnable Spanish outpost is guarded by the blood-swiller Cazalla, a favorite commander of King Philip IV himself. With the governor\u2032s backing, Hunter assembles a roughneck crew to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon, along with its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloody legends of Matanceros suggest, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he finds himself on the island\u2032s shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry are all that stand between him and the treasure.   With the help of his cunning crew, Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly clutches of Cazalla, leaving plenty of carnage in his wake. But his troubles have just begun. . . .", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2010", "edition": "First edition", "publisher": "Harpercollins", "language": "english", "pages": "320", "ISBN10": "0061938742", "ISBN13": "9780061929373", "file": "EPUB, 381 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/941237/cbb965"},

Newly updated and expanded with the author\u2019s preferred text, this commemorative volume is a true celebration of a modern masterpiece by the one, the only, Neil Gaiman.   A storm is coming . . .   Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the magic day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life.   But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow\u2019s best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself.   Life as Wednesday\u2019s bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined\u2014it is a job that takes him on a dark and strange road trip and introduces him to a host of eccentric characters whose fates are mysteriously intertwined with his own. Along the way Shadow will learn that the past never dies; that everyone, including his beloved Laura, harbors secrets; and that dreams, totems, legends, and myths are more real than we know. Ultimately, he will discover that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing\u2014an epic war for the very soul of America\u2014and that he is standing squarely in its path.

Her seven-year-old sister Miranda was knocked down and killed by the abductor\u2019s van. The girls were in the care of their nanny, Sally Wilkinson.One of the witnesses to this tragic event was David Umber, a Ph.D student who was waiting at the village pub to keep an appointment with a man called Griffith who claimed he could help Umber with his researches into the letters of \u201cJunius,\u201d the pseudonymous eighteenth century polemicist who was his Ph.D subject. But Griffin failed to show up, and Umber never heard from him again. The two-year-old, Tamsin Hall, was never seen again either. The Hall family fell apart under the strain. Sally Wilkinson, the nanny, wound up living with Umber, whom she had met at the inquiry. But she never recovered from the incident, suffered increasingly from depression, and eventually committed suicide.In the spring of 2004, retired Chief Inspector George Sharp receives a letter signed \u201cJunius\u201d reproaching him for botching the 1981 investigation. Sharp confronts Umber, whose explanation for being at the scene of the tragedy has always seemed dubious. Obliged to accept Umber\u2019s denial of authorship of the letter, he nonetheless forces him to join in a search for the real culprit \u2014 and hence the long-concealed truth about what happened 23 years previously.

The supernatural alchemy for the ultimate weapon, encoded in an ancient biblical text, has fallen into the hands of the most ruthless secret society known to man\u2014the Nazi SS. Present Day. Dishonorably discharged from the armed forces after the events of The Promised War, Sam Deker is trying to build a new life in Los Angeles. But nightmares of the past continue to haunt his present, and Deker discovers that the unusual lightwave-induced torture he barely survived has changed him. The Pentagon, however, believes that change makes him the only one who can endure their top-secret neuro-simulation program known as the 34th Degree. The stunning technological breakthrough uses the sliced brain tissues of dead terrorists to enter their memories and glean priceless intel. Now Americans want to use the preserved brain tissue of SS General Ludwig von Berg, the legendary \u201cBaron of the Black Order,\u201d to send Deker back to 1943. Deker\u2019s mission is to discover the fate of the lost biblical text and steal its formulas before his counterparts in the Alignment, a 21st-century successor to the SS, beat the U.S. to it.\u00a0  The text not only spells out the end of the world, but the supernatural alchemy for Greek Fire, a thermodynamic technology that the ancient Greeks believed to have come from Atlantis and that the Americans now believe threatens the Earth.

Not to mention a lime. Anansi Boys God is dead. Meet the kids. When Fat Charlie's dad named something, it stuck. Like calling Fat Charlie \"Fat Charlie.\" Even now, twenty years later, Charlie Nancy can't shake that name, one of the many embarrassing \"gifts\" his father bestowed -- before he dropped dead on a karaoke stage and ruined Fat Charlie's life. Mr. Nancy left Fat Charlie things. Things like the tall, good-looking stranger who appears on Charlie's doorstep, who appears to be the brother he never knew. A brother as different from Charlie as night is from day, a brother who's going to show Charlie how to lighten up and have a little fun ... just like Dear Old Dad. And all of a sudden, life starts getting very interesting for Fat Charlie. Because, you see, Charlie's dad wasn't just any dad. He was Anansi, a trickster god, the spider-god. Anansi is the spirit of rebellion, able to overturn the social order, create wealth out of thin air, and baffle the devil. Some said he could cheat even Death himself. Returning to the territory he so brilliantly explored in his masterful New York Times bestseller, American Gods, the incomparable Neil Gaiman offers up a work of dazzling ingenuity, a kaleidoscopic journey deep into myth that is at once startling, terrifying, exhilarating, and fiercely funny -- a true wonder of a novel that confirms Stephen King's glowing assessment of the author as \"a treasure-house of story, and we are lucky to have him.\"", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2005", "publisher": "William Morrow", "language": "english", "pages": "352", "ISBN13": "9780060515188", "file": "EPUB, 359 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/838781/61056e"},

Martin has thrilled a generation of readers with his epic works of the imagination, most recently the critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling saga told in the novels A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords. Lisa Tuttle has won acclaim from fans of science fiction, horror, and fantasy alike\u2014 most recently for her haunting novel  The Pillow Friend. Now together they gift readers with this classic tale of a brilliantly rendered world of ironbound tradition, where a rebellious soul seeks to prove the power of a dream.The planet of Windhaven was not originally a home to humans, but it became one following the crash of a colony starship. It is a world of small islands, harsh weather, and monster-infested seas. Communication among the scattered settlements was virtually impossible until the discovery that, thanks to light gravity and a dense atmosphere, humans were able to fly with the aid of metal wings made of bits of the cannibalized spaceship.Many generations later, among the scattered islands that make up the water world of Windhaven, no one holds more prestige than the silver-winged flyers, who bring news, gossip, songs, and stories. They are romantic figures crossing treacherous oceans, braving shifting winds and sudden storms that could easily dash them from the sky to instant death. They are also members of an increasingly elite caste, for the wings\u2014always in limited quantity\u2014are growing gradually rarer as their bearers perish.With such elitism comes arrogance and a rigid adherence to hidebound tradition. And for the flyers, allowing just anyone to join their cadre is an idea that borders on heresy. Wings are meant only for the offspring of flyers\u2014now the new nobility of Windhaven. Except that sometimes life is not quite so neat.Maris of Amberly, a fisherman's daughter, was raised by a flyer and wants nothing more than to soar on the currents high above Windhaven. By tradition, however, the wings must go to her stepbrother, Coll, the flyer's legitimate son. But Coll wants only to be a singer, traveling the world by sea. So Maris challenges tradition, demanding that flyers be chosen on the basis of merit rather than inheritance. And when she wins that bitter battle, she discovers that her troubles are only beginning.For not all flyers are willing to accept the world's new structure, and as Maris battles to teach those who yearn to fly, she finds herself likewise fighting to preserve the integrity of a society she so longed to join\u2014not to mention the very fabric that holds her culture together.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2003", "publisher": "Bantam Books", "language": "english", "pages": "416", "ISBN10": "0553577905", "ISBN13": "9780553577907", "file": "MOBI , 475 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1259187/5bebe1"},

In 2005 Fox Searchlight announced it had acquired the Russian film adaptation for an American release. Interest in the books here is now set to reach a fever pitch.    Set in modern day Moscow, Night Watch is a world as elaborate and imaginative as Tolkien or the best Asimov. Living among us are the \"Others,\" an ancient race of humans with supernatural powers who swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light. A thousand-year treaty has maintained the balance of power, and the two sides coexist in an uneasy truce. But an ancient prophecy decrees that one supreme \"Other\" will rise up and tip the balance, plunging the world into a catastrophic war between the Dark and the Light. When a young boy with extraordinary powers emerges, fulfilling the first half of the prophecy, will the forces of the Light be able to keep the Dark from corrupting the boy and destroying the world?    An extraordinary translation from the Russian by noted translator Andrew Bromfield, this first English language edition of Night Watch is a chilling, engrossing read certain to reward those waiting in anticipation of its arrival.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Action & Adventure", "year": "2006", "edition": "Tra", "publisher": "Miramax", "language": "english", "pages": "464 / 182", "ISBN10": "1401359795", "ISBN13": "9781401359799", "file": "PDF, 639 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/959286", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/959286/17f583"},

The incorrigible Miss Ruffles is a Texas Cattle Cur, not a cuddly lapdog, and when Honeybelle was alive, Miss Ruffles liked nothing better than digging up Honeybelle's famous rose garden after breakfast, chasing off the UPS man before lunch and terrorizing the many gentleman callers who came knocking at cocktail hour.But now Miss Ruffles is in danger, and it's up to Sunny McKillip, the unwilling dogsitter, to keep her safe. Sunny is new to Texas, and sometimes she feels as if she's fallen into an alien world. If it isn't the pistol-packing football fans and the sweet-talking, yet ruthless ladies of the garden club who confound her, it's the rowdy rodeo hounds and the tobacco-spitting curmudgeon at Critter Control who have her buffaloed. With a killer on the loose and a cowboy lawyer keeping a suspicious eye on her every move, Sunny needs all the help she can get understanding how Texans think. There's more to Honeybelle's death than meets this Yankee's eye, and Sunny has Miss Ruffles to protect, too. It's a bucking bull ride of an adventure for Sunny, and if she's not careful she might just get killed . . . or her heart lassoed....in Nancy Martin's\u00a0Miss Ruffles Inherits Everything.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Cozy Mysteries & Amateur Sleuths", "year": "2015", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Minotaur Books", "language": "english", "pages": "318", "ISBN13": "9781250022417", "file": "EPUB, 805 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/4709369/192c65"},

As Watts attempted to do the same to 20-year-old Lori Lister, her roommate Melinda Aguilar, 18, made a daring escape, leading to Watts' arrest. Watts was a sadistic slayer with a lust for killing in a variety of ways: strangulation, suffocation, drowning, and stabbing. He confessed to thirteen murders, but with no direct evidence to link him to the crimes, he managed to plea bargain his sentence down to 60 years for burglary. Due to a legal flaw in the Texas criminal justice system, Watts was supposed to be released from prison in 2006. Through the ceaseless efforts of investigators and the mother of one of the victims, Watts was finally tried and convicted to life in prison for a murder he'd committed in Michigan in 1979. He remains the prime suspect in approximately 90 other slayings. Experts theorize that Watts may have slain more than Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and John Wayne Gacy...combined!

With the help of the spirited Freya Wryton, the Earl's niece, he is drawn back into active service, and the ancient town of Selchester is dragged into the intrigues and conspiracies of the Cold War era.

For this attorney, it\u2019s either win... or lose everything. Defense attorney Brad Madison likes to call the shots. And normally he gets to choose his clients. Not this time. When Walter Powell is accused of killing his ex-girlfriend, property mogul Rubin Ashby asks Brad to defend him. But it\u2019s not a request; it\u2019s an order. Brad loathes Ashby; his mother lost a fortune in one of Ashby\u2019s failed property schemes. But he's forced to make a deal: clear Powell\u2019s name and his mother\u2019s loss will be repaid. In the third standalone book of the series, the deeper Brad delves into the case, the more enemies he makes. Corrupt police officers, a spiteful prosecutor, vicious henchmen, and hostile corporate lawyers all turn on him. Brad soon realizes there's far more at stake here than his mother\u2019s money or Powell\u2019s freedom. This is not just a battle for justice Brad has gotten himself into \u2026 it\u2019s a fight for his life. To win, he must risk everything.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Legal", "year": "2020", "language": "english", "file": "MOBI , 371 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16721211/992d3a"},

Worried about whether she still has what it takes after so much time away, Laurie finds her first case back to be a dangerous puzzler of the highest order, involving organized crime and two start-up bio-tech companies caught in a zero- sum game.  Against the advice of her colleagues and her husband, fellow medical examiner Jack Stapleton, Laurie is determined to solve the mystery the case comes to represent.  Satoshi Machita, a former Kyoto University researcher, is set to own a valuable patent controlling pluripotent stem cells, which are destined to spark a trillion-dollar industry of regenerative medicine. When he dies on a crowded New York subway platform, Laurie must decide whether his death was natural - or something more fiendish.  Behind the scenes, there are people who would like to see Laurie as far away from the investigation as possible. Despite threats against her, Laurie presses on, until threats are carried out against the person she loves most in the world: her son, JJ.  Suddenly Laurie must face solving the crime - and saving her son's life.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Medical", "year": "2010", "edition": "First British Edition", "publisher": "Putnam Adult", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0399156623", "ISBN13": "9780399156625", "file": "EPUB, 370 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1060509/cb3457"},

John Stapleton: eerst verliest hij zijn goedlopende oogartsenpraktijk aan een gigantisch, uitsluitend op maximale winst gericht medisch concern... en vervolgens komt zijn hele familie om bij een tragisch vliegtuigongeval. Verbitterd laat Stapleton zich omscholen in de forensische pathologie en vestigt hij zich in de onpersoonlijke, betonnen anonimiteit van New York. Langzaamaan lijkt zijn leven weer in rustiger vaarwater te raken. Tot het moment dat een hele reeks heftige en uitermate dodelijke ziekten jong en oud treffen, met als absolute climax een fatale griepepidemie. Stapletons argwaan wordt gewekt, vooral wanneer kan worden aangetoond dat de besmettingshaarden zich bevinden in de ziekenhuizen en klinieken die vallen onder de verantwoordelijkheid van dezelfde meedogenloze medische gigant die indertijd het einde betekende van zijn eigen artsenpraktijk... Samen met de succesvolle zakenvrouw Theresa Hagen - de enige die zijn leven weer een beetje zin weet te geven - ontrafelt Stapleton de verbijsterende waarheid. Zij komen een duivelse samenzwering van werkelijk catastrofale proporties op het spoor...", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Medical", "year": "2014", "language": "dutch", "file": "EPUB, 493 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/16916630/5b7ce5"},

He thinks there's a connection between the appearance of the mysterious microbes responsible for the deaths and the HMO that owns the hospital--the same HMO that once destroyed his flourishing medical practice. Is Americare deliberately killing off its sickest patients--those who cost the most money to treat? Or is there an even more sinister motive behind the strange goings-on at Manhattan General, not to mention the attempts on Jack's life? And what is beautiful Terese Hagen, the hard-driving creative director of a Madison Avenue ad agency, doing in the middle of this slightly muddled, but still engrossing, tale of greed, medicine, and mayhem?

Still, Contagion will make you think twice about taking your next case of flu to the ER instead of your own bed. --Jane AdamsFrom Library JournalIn Cook's numerous best-selling medical thrillers, the nasty microbes and lethal diseases are never as loathsome as the greedy villains who spread illness for profit.

Once a highly regarded ophthalmologist, Jack's career took a dramatic turn after a tragic accident that destroyed his family. But that, too, is very much in the past: Jack has remarried-to longtime colleague and fellow medical examiner Laurie Montgomery-and is the father of a young child. But his renegade, activist personality can't rest, and after performing a postmortem on a young college student who had recently been treated by a chiropractor, Jack decides to explore alternative medicine. What makes some people step outside the medical establishment to seek care from practitioners of Eastern philosophies and even faith healers? Jack's classmate Shawn Doherty is now a renowned archeologist and biblical scholar at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, whose taste for good wine and generally deteriorating health are taking a toll on his career. He has recently obtained permission for a final dig beneath Saint Peter's, and despite his long-standing grudge against the Catholic Church, begins his research-which eventually takes him to Jerusalem and Venice -only to make a startling discovery with ecclesiastical and medical implications. And when James O'Rourke, now Bishop of the Archdiocese of New York, gets wind of Shawn's findings, he's desperate to keep them from the public. James has strong political ambitions within the Church, but his association with Shawn threatens to undermine them. James turns to his old friend Jack to help protect an explosive secret-one with the power to change lives forever.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Medical", "year": "2009", "language": "english", "pages": "300", "ISBN13": "9781101130902", "file": "PDF, 1007 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/3953968", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/3953968/baf49a"},

The story begins with the shooting of two would-be looters in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, and then follows a motley group of characters - from street thugs to a big-time mob boss, from a junkie priest to a sadistic psychopath - as their stories converge on a cache of stolen diamonds, while the storm turns the Big Easy into a lawless wasteland of apocalyptic proportions.  The nightmarish landscape created by Katrina seems the perfect setting for Burke's almost Biblical visions of good and evil - it is as if he had to wait for this disaster to find the occasion to match his emotionally supercharged prose. You can feel the undercurrents of rage and pain beneath the narrative, making this not only his most personal and deeply felt book for some time, but quite possibly his best novel to date.

But Conan Doyle didn't reveal all of the Great Detective's adventures...Here are some of the best Holmes pastiches of the last 30 years, twenty-eight tales of mystery and the imagination detailing Holmes's further exploits, as told by many of today's greatest storytellers, including Stephen King, Anne Perry, Anthony Burgess, Neil Gaiman, Naomi Novik, Stephen Baxter, Tanith Lee, Michael Moorcock, and many more.These are the improbable adventures of Sherlock Holmes, where nothing is impossible, and nothing can be ruled out. In these cases, Holmes investigates ghosts, curses, aliens, dinosaurs, shapeshifters, and evil gods. But is it the supernatural, or is there a perfectly rational explanation?You won't be sure, and neither will Holmes and Watson as they match wits with pirates, assassins, con artists, and criminal masterminds of all stripes, including some familiar foes, such as their old nemesis, Professor Moriarty.In these pages you'll also find our heroes crossing paths with H. G. Wells, Lewis Carroll, and even Arthur Conan Doyle himself, and you'll be astounded to learn the truth behind cases previously alluded to by Watson but never before documented until now.These are tales that take us from the familiar quarters at 221B Baker Street to alternate realities, from the gaslit streets of London to the far future and beyond.Whether it's mystery, fantasy, horror, or science fiction, no puzzle is too challenging for the Great Detective.

Vice-Questore Patta is eager to dismiss the case as a death from natural causes, but Brunetti believes there is more to it than that. His suspicions are further aroused when the medical examiner finds faint bruising around the victim's neck and shoulders, indicating that someone might have grabbed and shaken her. Could this have caused her heart attack? Was someone threatening her? Conversations with the woman's son, her upstairs neighbour, and the nun in charge of the old-age home where she volunteered, do little to satisfy Brunetti's nagging curiosity. With the help of Inspector Vianello and the ever-resourceful Signorina Elettra, Brunetti is determined to get to the truth and find some measure of justice.

At the same time, he is haunted by the unresolved cases of two young people who went missing thirty years before, and, inevitably, his discoveries raise ghosts from his own past.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Other Mystery Categories", "year": "2009", "edition": "1st Canadian Edition", "language": "english", "pages": "320", "ISBN10": "0307357821", "ISBN13": "9780307357823", "file": "EPUB, 904 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/913600/286743"},

The \"Body Farm\" is a place where human corpses are left to the elements, and every manner of decay is fully explored -- for the sake of science and the cause of justice. The scientist who created the Body Farm has broken cold cases and revolutionized forensics, and now, in this heart-stopping novel, he spins an astonishing tale inspired by his own experiences. A woman's corpse lies hidden in a cave in the mountains of East Tennessee. Undiscovered for thirty years, her body has been transformed by the cave's chemistry into a near-perfect mummy -- one that discloses an explosive secret to renowned anthropologist Bill Brockton. Dr. Brockton has spent his career surrounded by death and decay at the Body Farm, but even he is baffled by this case unfolding in a unique environment where nothing is quite what it seems. The surreal setting is Cooke County, a remote mountain community that's clannish, insular, and distrustful of outsiders. The heartbreaking discovery of the young woman's corpse reopens old wounds and rekindles feuds dating back decades. The county's powerful and uncooperative sheriff and his inept deputy threaten to derail Brockton's investigation altogether. So do Brockton's other nemeses: his lingering guilt over the death of his wife, and the fury of a medical examiner whom Brockton dares to oppose in court. Carved in Bone is a richly atmospheric, superbly suspenseful, and magnificently rendered trip into the world of forensic science, the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, and the dark passageways of the human psyche. Full of vivid characters and startling twists and turns, this thrilling novel heralds the debut of a major new voice in crime fiction -- and an unforgettable work from the hand of a scientific legend.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Other Mystery Categories", "year": "2010", "edition": "First Edition", "publisher": "William Morrow", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "006075981X", "ISBN13": "9780062076830", "file": "EPUB, 1.58 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1049917/c5581e"},

Lo sigue hasta la\u00a0rue de Marais\u00a0donde encuentra a su primera v\u00edctima: una joven adolecente pelirroja excepcionalmente bella, que se encuentra quitando las semillas de unas ciruelas amarillas. Grenouille la asesina para poder poseer su aroma.El protagonista, consciente de su talento \u00fanico, decide trabajar en perfumer\u00eda y llama la atenci\u00f3n del perfumista m\u00e1s prestigioso de Par\u00eds, Baldini. Bajo Baldini, Grenouille aprende los procesos qu\u00edmicos para destilar y materializar perfumes.Luego de unos a\u00f1os adquiere su libertad y decide recluirse en la soledad de una caverna. Transcurren siete a\u00f1os, hasta que un d\u00eda tiene una pesadilla y se da cuenta de que \u00e9l mismo no tiene ning\u00fan olor.Encuentra al Marqu\u00e9s de la Taillade-Espinasse, un hombre interesado en comprobar la teor\u00eda del fluido vital que establec\u00eda que los objetos relacionados con el aire son sanadores. Para esto decide tomar como ejemplo a Grenouille, por haber vivido en una alta cueva.Grenouille por su parte logra fabricar un perfume que es imitaci\u00f3n de la esencia humana, as\u00ed es percibido por otros como uno m\u00e1s. Con esto, decide partir rumbo a Grasse y trabaja en el taller de perfumer\u00eda de madame Arnulfi, bajo el mando de su amante Druot.Con el prop\u00f3sito de continuar sus experimentos para crear aromas humanos, Grenouille empieza a asesinar a j\u00f3venes mujeres v\u00edrgenes. Las mata con un golpe en la cabeza, rapa su cabello y las envuelve en grasa animal para poder destilar su aroma. As\u00ed asesina a 24 j\u00f3venes.Reina el caos y los asesinatos cesan cuando el obispo decreta que el asesino ha quedado excomulgado. Antoine Richis, oficial de alto rango de Grasse, no conf\u00eda en que los asesinatos hayan terminado. Astutamente, deduce que el asesino es una especie de coleccionista y que en esta colecci\u00f3n su hija, Laure Richis, la mujer m\u00e1s bella de Grasse, es la \u00fanica pieza que falta.Decide partir de repente con su hija a una posada lejana. Pero Grenouille, siguiendo su aroma la encuentra y la asesina.Finalmente crea el perfume deseado, con la combinaci\u00f3n del aroma de todas las mujeres que ha asesinado. Es capturado, pero antes de ser crucificado, se aplica el perfume. Todos los que acuden se convencen de que Grenouille es un \u00e1ngel, y entre los asistentes se genera una org\u00eda.Grenouille, decepcionado, comprende que puede hacer que otros lo amen pero no puede amar.

There is much more to this story than a 34-year-old letter. It\u2019s a 34-year-old mystery!Today, a double murder has the whole town under a microscope. The state attorney general appoints Joshua special prosecutor to solve the crimes. In a small town where gossip flies as swiftly as a spring breeze it is impossible to know who to trust.Asking simple questions about events long ago could prove to be deadly for Joshua and his family.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Other Thrillers Categories", "year": "2014", "edition": "1", "publisher": "Acorn Book Services", "language": "english", "pages": "326", "file": "EPUB, 2.13 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/11482558/7bcc8f"},

Playing a key role in the industrial revolution, it\r\n helped shape the nation\u2019s manufacturing industry But with its \r\nmany green spaces, Birmingham also borders on the beautiful countryside \r\nof Worcestershire and Warwickshire, is just a few miles from Stratford \r\non Avon and a short drive from the wild country of mid-Wales. \r\nBirmingham\u2019s population is large and ethnically diverse, and while urban\r\n regeneration has forged a modern and culturally vibrant city, the \r\ndecaying remnants of the industrial past and 1960s concrete jungle give \r\nit a unique and gritty character; the dark underbelly policed by DI Tom \r\nMariner and his team. THE DETECTIVE Detective \r\nInspector Tom Mariner is, on the surface, an average dedicated \r\npoliceman, but his experiences as a younger man have given him an \r\ninsight into life on the dark side, and a clear sense of right and \r\nwrong. Mariner has little interest in material things. He lives in a \r\nmodest canal-side cottage, enjoys the occasional (real) beer and game of\r\n dominoes and drives an old car. He is most at home in the outdoors, \r\nwith an OS map and a compass, and in times of crisis, will take off and \r\nwalk for miles in any weather.

Fern is the quirky one, the free spirit, the librarian who avoids social interaction and whom the world might just describe as truly odd. But the sisters are devoted to one another and Rose has always been Fern's protector from the time they were small.

Years ago, Fern did something very, very bad. And Rose has never told a soul. When Fern decides to help her sister achieve her heart's desire of having a baby, Rose realizes with growing horror that Fern might make choices that can only have a terrible outcome. What Rose doesn't realize is that Fern is growing more and more aware of the secrets Rose, herself, is keeping. And that their mother might have the last word after all.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.\u00a0One of the leading popularizers of classical learning in the nineteenth century, Thomas Bulfinch made the myths and legends of the ancient and medieval world available to American audiences through his three decisive works, The Age of Fable, The Age of Chivalry, and Legends of Charlemagne, collectively published and widely known as Bulfinch\u2019s Mythology.\u00a0 \u00a0A banking clerk by day, Bulfinch spent his nights skillfully weaving often disparate versions of classical and medieval mythology into a coherent whole. The thoroughness with which he combed through his sources made his mythological books standard reference guides for many years, while the vigor of his storytelling enthralled generations of readers. Written to \u201cteach mythology not as a study but as a relaxation from study,\u201d these timeless volumes span the ages: The Age Of Fable describes the gods and goddesses of Greece and Rome, as well as the mythology of the Germanic tribes, England, and the Near East; The Age of Chivalry tells the story of King Arthur and his court, Lancelot and Guinevere, and the death of Arthur; and Legends of Charlemagne gives a thrilling account of the reign of the first great French emperor, his wars, and his conquests.\u00a0Charles Martin is a poet and translator. His verse translation of Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses was published in 2003 by W. W. Norton and received the Harold Morton Landon Award from the Academy of American Poets for 2004.

America's premier living author of short fiction, Bradbury has spent many lifetimes in this remarkable place--strolling through empty, shadow-washed fields at midnight; exploring long-forgotten rooms gathering dust behind doors bolted years ago to keep strangers locked out.. and secrets locked in. The nights are longer in this country. The cold hours of darkness move like autumn mists deeper and deeper toward winter. But the moonlight reveals great magic here--and a breathtaking vista.The October Country is many places: a picturesque Mexican village where death is a tourist attraction; a city beneath the city where drowned lovers are silently reunited; a carnival midway where a tiny man's most cherished fantasy can be fulfilled night after night. The October Country's inhabitants live, dream, work, die--and sometimes live again--discovering, often too late, the high price of citizenship. Here a glass jar can hold memories and nightmares; a woman's newborn child can plot murder; and a man's skeleton can war against him. Here there is no escaping the dark stranger who lives upstairs...or the reaper who wields the world. Each of these stories is a wonder, imagined by an acclaimed tale-teller writing from a place shadows. But there is astonishing beauty in these shadows, born from a prose that enchants and enthralls. Ray Bradbury's The October Country is a land of metaphors that can chill like a long-after-midnight wind...as they lift the reader high above a sleeping Earth on the strange wings of Uncle Einar.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Short Stories", "year": "1999", "edition": "1st", "publisher": "Avon Books", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "0380973871", "ISBN13": "9780380973873", "file": "EPUB, 274 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1082648/ab05e5"},

Fifteen years later, Martin is living in Iran with his wife and young son, while Nasim is in charge of the virtual world known as Zendegi, used by millions of people for entertainment and business. When Zendegi comes under threat from powerful competitors, Nasim draws on her old skills, and data from the now-completed Human Connectome Project, to embark on a program to create more life-like virtual characters and give the company an unbeatable edge. As controversy grows over the nature and rights of these software characters, tragedy strikes Martin's family. Martin turns to Nasim, seeking a solution that no one else can offer ... but Zendegi is about to become a battlefield.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Short Stories", "year": "2010", "publisher": "Gollancz  The Orion Publishing Group Ltd", "language": "english", "ISBN10": "1597801747", "ISBN13": "9781597801744", "file": "EPUB, 422 KB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1049452/040b31"},

Now THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES OF THE CENTURY brings together the best of the best - fifty-five extraordinary stories that represent a century's worth of unsurpassed accomplishments in this quintessentially American literary genre. Here are the stories that have endured the test of time: masterworks by such writers as Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Willa Cather, F. Scott Fitzgerald,  William Saroyan, Flannery O'Connor, John Cheever, Eudora Welty, Philip Roth, Joyce Carol Oates, Raymond Carver, Cynthia Ozick, and scores of others. These are the writers who have shaped and defined the landscape of the American short story, who have unflinchingly explored all aspects of the human condition, and whose works will continue to speak to us as we enter the next century. Their artistry is represented splendidly in these pages. THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES series has also always been known for making literary discoveries, and discovery proved to be an essential part of selecting the stories for this volume too. Collections from years past yielded a rich harvest of surprises, stories that may have been forgotten but still retain their relevance and luster. The result is a volume that not only gathers some of the most significant stories of our century between two covers but resurrects a handful of lost literary gems as well. Of all the great writers whose work has appeared in the series, only John Updike's contributions have spanned five consecutive decades, from his first appearance, in 1959, to his most recent, in 1998. Updike worked with coeditor Katrina Kenison to choose stories from each decade that meet his own high standards of literary quality.", "categories": "Crime, Thrillers & Mystery - Short Stories", "year": "2000", "edition": "1ST", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "language": "english", "pages": "862", "ISBN10": "0395843677", "ISBN13": "9780395843680", "file": "PDF, 14.70 MB", "preview_link": "https://1lib.us/ireader/1178800", "download_link": "https://1lib.us/dl/1178800/74e5a5"},
